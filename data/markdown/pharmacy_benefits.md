2. **ToggleHealth Reviews:**
   - Clinical pharmacists review request
   - Compare to coverage criteria
   - May request additional information

## Generic Substitution Policy

### Automatic Generic Substitution

When a generic version of a medication is available, ToggleHealth requires use of the generic unless:

1. Doctor specifies "dispense as written" (DAW) for medical necessity
2. Prior authorization approved for brand medication

### Cost Difference if You Choose Brand

If you request brand-name when generic is available (and not medically necessary):
- You pay Tier 3 brand copay
- PLUS the cost difference between brand and generic

**Example:**
- Generic statin: $10 copay (Platinum PPO)
- Brand Crestor requested: $50 copay + $150 difference = $200 total

### Medical Necessity for Brand

If your doctor determines the brand medication is medically necessary:
- Doctor submits prior authorization
- If approved, you pay only the brand copay
- If denied, you can appeal

---

## Quantity Limits and Refill Restrictions

### Standard Quantity Limits

Some medications have quantity limits to ensure safe use:

**Examples:**
- Pain medications: 30-day supply maximum
- Sleep medications: 30-day supply maximum
- Certain migraine medications: 9 doses per month

### Early Refill Restrictions

Prescriptions cannot be refilled until you've used 75% of previous fill.

**Exceptions:**

## Step Therapy Requirements

### What is Step Therapy?

Step therapy (also called "fail first") requires you to try a lower-cost medication before a higher-cost option is covered.

**Common Step Therapy Examples:**

**Acid Reflux:**
1. Try generic omeprazole first (Tier 1)
2. If ineffective, try Nexium (Tier 3)

**Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
1. Try methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine first
2. If ineffective, try biologic like Humira (Tier 4)

### Step Therapy Exceptions

You can skip steps if:
- You've already tried and failed the lower-tier medication
- The lower-tier medication is contraindicated (medically inappropriate)
- Doctor provides medical necessity documentation

**To Request Exception:**

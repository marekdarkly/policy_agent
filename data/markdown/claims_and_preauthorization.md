## Preauthorization (Prior Authorization)

### What is Preauthorization?

Preauthorization is advance approval from ToggleHealth before receiving certain medical services. This ensures the service is medically necessary and covered under your plan.

**Also called:** Prior authorization, pre-approval, pre-certification

### Why is Preauthorization Required?

- Ensures medical necessity
- Prevents unnecessary procedures
- Manages costs
- Confirms coverage before you receive care

**Important:** Preauthorization does NOT guarantee payment. You must still meet eligibility requirements and service must be rendered as authorized.

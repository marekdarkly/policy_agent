## Frequently Asked Questions - Gold HMO

**Q: What's the difference between Gold HMO and Platinum PPO?**
A: Gold HMO requires a PCP and referrals, is in-network only, and has lower premiums. Platinum PPO offers more flexibility with no PCP, no referrals, out-of-network coverage, but higher premiums.

**Q: Can I change my PCP?**
A: Yes. You can change your PCP at any time by calling Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 or online at my.togglehealth.com. Changes are effective the 1st of the following month.

**Q: What if I need to see a specialist?**
A: Contact your PCP first. They will evaluate your condition and provide a referral if specialist care is needed. You cannot see a specialist without a referral (except OB/GYN).

**Q: What happens if I see a specialist without a referral?**
A: The visit will not be covered and you will be responsible for the full cost of the visit.

A: Only for emergency care. The Gold HMO plan does not cover out-of-network care except for emergencies.

**Q: What if I receive emergency care while traveling?**

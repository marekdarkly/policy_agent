## How the Bronze HDHP Works

### Before Deductible is Met

**You pay:** 100% of all costs (except preventive care)

**Plan pays:** 0% (except preventive care which is covered 100%)

**Example:** Doctor visit costs $150. You pay $150. This counts toward your $6,500 deductible.

### After Deductible is Met

**You pay:** $0

**Plan pays:** 100%

**Example:** Doctor visit costs $150. You pay $0. The plan pays $150.

### Preventive Care (Always Covered)

**You pay:** $0

**Plan pays:** 100%

**Example:** Annual physical exam. You pay $0 regardless of deductible status.

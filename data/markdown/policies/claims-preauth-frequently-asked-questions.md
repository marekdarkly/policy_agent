## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens if I don't get preauthorization when required?**
A: The service may not be covered and you could be responsible for the full cost. Always confirm preauthorization requirements before receiving care.

**Q: How long does preauthorization last?**
A: Typically 30-90 days depending on the service. Authorization letters specify the valid timeframe.

**Q: Can I get preauthorization after I've already received the service?**
A: Generally no. Preauthorization must be obtained before receiving care. Retroactive authorization is only considered in rare emergency situations.

**Q: What if my preauthorization is denied?**
A: You have the right to appeal. You can also discuss alternative covered treatments with your doctor.

**Q: Do I need preauthorization for every MRI?**
A: Yes. All advanced imaging (MRI, CT, PET scans) requires preauthorization unless it's part of emergency care.

**Q: How do I know if a service requires preauthorization?**
A: Check your plan documents, call Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1, or ask your provider's office to verify.

**Q: Does preauthorization guarantee coverage?**
A: No. Preauthorization confirms the service is medically necessary and covered, but you must still be eligible and enrolled at time of service.

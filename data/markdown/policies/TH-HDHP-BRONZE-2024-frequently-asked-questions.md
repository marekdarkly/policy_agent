## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is a high-deductible health plan?**
A: An HDHP has a higher deductible than traditional plans but lower premiums. You pay all costs until you meet the deductible, then the plan pays 100%. It's designed for people who want to save on premiums and use an HSA.

**Q: How does the HSA work?**
A: A Health Savings Account lets you save pre-tax money for medical expenses. ToggleHealth contributes $750 (individual) or $1,500 (family). You can contribute additional funds up to IRS limits. Use the money tax-free for medical expenses.

**Q: What if I can't afford the $6,500 deductible?**
A: Consider if this plan is right for you. However, the HSA helps - you'll have $750 from the employer, and you can save additional pre-tax dollars. Also remember you're saving $5,280/year in premiums vs Platinum PPO.

**Q: Are there any copays?**
A: No. The Bronze HDHP does not have copays. You pay 100% of costs until the deductible is met, then 0%.

**Q: Is preventive care free?**
A: Yes. Preventive care (annual physicals, screenings, immunizations) is covered at 100% even before you meet your deductible.

**Q: What happens to my HSA if I change plans?**
A: The HSA is YOUR account. The money stays with you even if you change insurance plans or jobs. However, you can only contribute to an HSA while enrolled in an HSA-eligible HDHP.

**Q: Can I use my HSA for my spouse or children?**
A: Yes. You can use HSA funds tax-free for qualified medical expenses for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents.

**Q: What counts as a qualified medical expense?**
A: Medical, dental, vision care, prescriptions, mental health services, and many other healthcare expenses. See IRS Publication 502 for a complete list.

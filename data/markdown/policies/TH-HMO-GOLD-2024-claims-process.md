## Claims Process

### In-Network Claims

When you see in-network providers (providers in the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network), they will file claims directly with ToggleHealth. You are responsible only for copays, coinsurance, and deductibles.

**You don't need to file claims for in-network care.**

### Out-of-Network Services

**Important:** The Gold HMO plan does NOT cover out-of-network services except for emergency care. If you see an out-of-network provider for non-emergency care, you will be responsible for the full cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use any pharmacy?**
A: You must use pharmacies in the ToggleHealth Pharmacy Network. Using out-of-network pharmacies will result in higher costs or no coverage (except emergencies).

**Q: How do I know what tier my medication is in?**
A: Use the online formulary search at my.togglehealth.com/formulary or call Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1.

**Q: What if my medication requires prior authorization?**
A: Your doctor will submit the prior authorization request. You can check status online or by calling 1-800-TOGGLE-2.

**Q: Can I get a 90-day supply at retail pharmacy?**
A: Some pharmacies offer 90-day supplies, but you'll pay three retail copays. Mail order is more cost-effective (2x retail copay for 90 days).

**Q: What if my medication isn't on the formulary?**
A: Your doctor can request an exception through the prior authorization process. If approved, the medication will be covered.

**Q: How do I transfer prescriptions to mail order?**
A: Call 1-800-TOGGLE-4 and provide your current pharmacy information. ToggleHealth Mail Order will handle the transfer.

**Q: Are medications covered while I'm traveling?**
A: Yes. You can fill prescriptions at any in-network pharmacy nationwide. For international travel, bring adequate supply or use mail order before traveling.

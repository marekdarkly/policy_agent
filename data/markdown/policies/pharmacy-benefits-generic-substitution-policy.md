## Generic Substitution Policy

### Automatic Generic Substitution

When a generic version of a medication is available, ToggleHealth requires use of the generic unless:

1. Doctor specifies "dispense as written" (DAW) for medical necessity
2. Prior authorization approved for brand medication

### Cost Difference if You Choose Brand

If you request brand-name when generic is available (and not medically necessary):
- You pay Tier 3 brand copay
- PLUS the cost difference between brand and generic

**Example:**
- Generic statin: $10 copay (Platinum PPO)
- Brand Crestor requested: $50 copay + $150 difference = $200 total

### Medical Necessity for Brand

If your doctor determines the brand medication is medically necessary:
- Doctor submits prior authorization
- If approved, you pay only the brand copay
- If denied, you can appeal

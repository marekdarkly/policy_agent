## Frequently Asked Questions - Platinum PPO

**Q: Do I need to choose a primary care physician with the Platinum PPO?**
A: No. The Platinum PPO does not require you to select a PCP. You have the freedom to see any in-network provider.

**Q: Do I need a referral to see a specialist?**
A: No. You can see any specialist directly without a referral.

**Q: Can I see out-of-network providers?**
A: Yes. The Platinum PPO covers out-of-network providers at 60% after you meet the out-of-network deductible ($1,500 individual / $3,000 family).

**Q: What if I need care while traveling?**
A: Emergency care is covered anywhere in the United States at in-network rates. For non-emergency care, you may use out-of-network benefits or see in-network providers in the PPO-PREMIER network across five states.

**Q: How does the Premium Concierge Service work?**
A: All Platinum PPO members receive a dedicated care navigator who can help with appointment scheduling, finding specialists, coordinating care, and answering benefits questions. Call 1-800-TOGGLE-1 and ask for Concierge Services.

**Q: What's the difference between Platinum PPO and Gold HMO?**
A: Platinum PPO offers more flexibility (no PCP, no referrals, out-of-network coverage), lower out-of-pocket costs, and Premium Concierge Service. Gold HMO has lower premiums but requires a PCP and referrals for specialists.

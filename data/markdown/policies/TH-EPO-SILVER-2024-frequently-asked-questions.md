## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I see out-of-network providers?**
A: No. The Silver EPO does NOT cover out-of-network services except for emergency care. All non-emergency care must be received from TH-EPO-SELECT network providers.

**Q: Do I need a referral to see a specialist?**
A: No. You can see any in-network specialist directly without a referral.

**Q: What's the difference between Silver EPO and Gold HMO?**
A: Silver EPO has no referral requirement and higher deductibles but lower premiums. Gold HMO requires a PCP and referrals but has better cost sharing.

**Q: Why is the network smaller than other plans?**
A: The EPO network is curated to include high-quality providers. This allows us to offer lower premiums while maintaining quality care.

## Step Therapy Requirements

### What is Step Therapy?

Step therapy (also called "fail first") requires you to try a lower-cost medication before a higher-cost option is covered.

**Common Step Therapy Examples:**

**Acid Reflux:**
1. Try generic omeprazole first (Tier 1)
2. If ineffective, try Nexium (Tier 3)

**Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
1. Try methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine first
2. If ineffective, try biologic like Humira (Tier 4)

### Step Therapy Exceptions

You can skip steps if:
- You've already tried and failed the lower-tier medication
- The lower-tier medication is contraindicated (medically inappropriate)
- Doctor provides medical necessity documentation

**To Request Exception:**
- Doctor submits prior authorization with documentation
- Clinical review conducted
- Decision within 3-5 business days

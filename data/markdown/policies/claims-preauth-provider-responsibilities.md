## Provider Responsibilities

### Provider Preauthorization Responsibilities

In-network providers are responsible for:
- Obtaining preauthorization when required
- Submitting complete clinical documentation
- Following up on pending requests
- Notifying you of authorization status

**Important:** Even though providers are responsible, YOU should always confirm preauthorization was obtained before receiving services.

### Member Responsibilities

As a member, you should:
- Ask your provider if preauthorization is needed
- Confirm preauthorization was requested and approved
- Provide your authorization number at time of service
- Keep copies of authorization letters

**Tip:** Before any surgery or expensive procedure, call Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 to verify preauthorization status.

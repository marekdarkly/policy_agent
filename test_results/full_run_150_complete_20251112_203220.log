📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The system fabricated contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1), website URLs (my.togglehealth.com/find-provider), and made unsupported claims about HMO referral requirements that are not mentioned in the retrieved documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Invented website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in source documents
     - Made unsupported claim about HMO referral requirements - no referral policy information exists in RAG context
     - Added fictional business hours 'Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT' not present in any retrieved document
     - No fertility specialists exist in the RAG documents, but response suggests they might be found through other channels without evidence

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in explaining search options and one instance where 'fertility specialist' could have been more precisely defined as 'reproductive endocrinologist' earlier.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I searched for fertility specialists in Chicago but didn't find any specific fertility specialists or reproductive endocrinologists in your area through our provider directory.
   
   However, I found these related specialists in Chicago who accept your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan:
   
   **Dr. Linda C. Lee, MD - Endocrinology**
   - Provider ID: SPEC-IL-092
   - Specialty: Endocrinology (Note: Different specialty, but endocrinologists sometimes work with reproductive health)
   - Practice: Chicago Endocrinology Center
   - Address: 2200 Specialty Drive, Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60112
   - Phone: 312-555-5161
   - Status: ✓ IN-NETWORK | Accepting new patients
   - Rating: 4.6/5.0 (563 reviews)
   - Languages: English
   - Years in Practice: 16
   
   **Options for finding fertility specialists:**
   
   1. **Contact Member Services** for specialized provider search:
      - Call: 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
      - They can search for reproductive endocrinologists or fertility clinics in your network
   
   2. **Visit the online provider directory:**
      - Go to: my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
      - Search specifically for "Reproductive Endocrinology" or "Fertility Medicine"
   
   3. **Ask your Primary Care Physician** for a referral:
      - Since you have an HMO plan, your PCP can provide referrals to fertility specialists
      - They may know of in-network fertility clinics not listed in our general directory
   
   **Important Note:** As an HMO member, you'll need a referral from your Primary Care Physician to see a fertility specialist for coverage.
   
   Would you like me to help you find your assigned PCP's contact information, or would you prefer to contact Member Services directly for fertility specialist options?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Avery,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I searched our provider directory for fertility specialists in Chicago, and while I didn't find any listed under that specific specialty, I do want to make sure you get connected with the right care.
   
   Here's what I found:
   
   **Related Provider in Your Network:**
   - **Dr. Linda C. Lee, MD** (Endocrinology)
     - Provider ID: SPEC-IL-092
     - Practice: Chicago Endocrinology Center
     - Address: 2200 Specialty Drive, Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60112
     - Phone: 312-555-5161
     - Status: ✓ In-network | Accepting new patients
     - Rating: 4.6/5.0 (563 reviews)
     - Years in Practice: 16
   
   While Dr. Lee specializes in endocrinology, endocrinologists sometimes work with reproductive health—but she may not be the fertility specialist you're looking for.
   
   **Here's how to find a fertility specialist:**
   
   1. **Call Member Services** for a specialized search:
      - Phone: 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
      - They can search specifically for reproductive endocrinologists or fertility clinics in your network
   
   2. **Search our online provider directory:**
      - Visit: my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
      - Search for "Reproductive Endocrinology" or "Fertility Medicine"
   
   3. **Ask your Primary Care Physician for a referral:**
      - Your PCP can connect you with in-network fertility specialists they know and trust
      - They may have access to fertility clinics not listed in our general directory
   
   **⚠️ Important:** Since you have an HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), you'll need a referral from your Primary Care Physician to see a fertility specialist for your coverage to apply.
   
   Would you like help finding your PCP's contact information, or would you prefer to reach out to Member Services directly? I'm here to help either way!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents about the Diabetes Management Program (DMP-2024). All benefits listed (quarterly care coordinator check-ins, free glucose monitor and test strips, 100% coverage for diabetes education classes, 6 nutritionist consultations per year) are explicitly stated in the source documents. The eligibility criteria and enrollment process are correctly presented.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The output doesn't mention that the program is available on all ToggleHealth plans, though this doesn't affect accuracy for the user's specific Gold HMO plan

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all benefits are clearly explained without jargon. Minor deduction for the phone number format '1-800-TOGGLE-1' which may create slight confusion about whether it's a real number.
   Issues:
     - Phone number format '1-800-TOGGLE-1' may be unclear - customers might wonder if this is a placeholder or actual number

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The system correctly identified that no OB/GYN providers were found in the RAG documents for San Diego, which only contained specialists in Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology. The response accurately reflects the user's plan details (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, HMO Network) from the context and provides appropriate next steps without fabricating provider information.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all next steps are clearly defined. Minor deduction for the slightly awkward name display 'Taylor Brown 3' which could be confusing to customers.

The system claims no bariatric surgeons are available in Houston, but the RAG documents don't contain any bariatric surgeons at all - they only list gastroenterologists, oncologists, orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, and other specialties. The response fabricates information about HMO referral requirements and coverage details not found in the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'we don't currently have any available' bariatric surgeons when RAG documents contain no bariatric surgeon listings to support this conclusion
     - Suggests expanding search to 'nearby cities' without any RAG evidence of bariatric surgeons in other locations
     - States HMO referral requirements and coverage details not found in the retrieved documents
     - Recommends contacting member services for coverage verification without RAG support for this process
     - Makes assumptions about plan coverage and network options not grounded in the provided knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional yet friendly tone. The numbered options and clear next steps make it easy to follow. Minor deduction for a small grammatical issue ('point you their way' should be 'point you in their direction').
   Issues:
     - Minor grammatical error in final sentence: 'point you their way' should be 'point you in their direction'

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Alex,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I searched our network for bariatric surgeons in Houston, but unfortunately, we don't currently have any available in your area right now.
   
   Here are a few options to help you move forward:
   
   1. **Expand your search** – We might have bariatric surgeons in nearby cities around Houston. Would you like me to look there?
   
   2. **Consider related specialists** – General surgeons or gastroenterologists may also be able to help with your needs. I can search for those in Houston if that interests you.
   
   3. **Get personalized help** – Our member services team can verify exactly what's covered under your Gold HMO plan and help you track down a bariatric surgeon, even if it means looking a bit further out. They're great at finding solutions!
   
   Since you're on an HMO plan, remember that you'll need to work with your primary care doctor first—they can provide a referral to a bariatric surgeon, which might open up additional options outside our immediate network.
   
   **What would be most helpful?** Let me know which option you'd like to explore, and I'm happy to dig deeper for you. Or if you'd prefer to chat with our member services team directly, I can point you their way.

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While the HMO referral requirement is correctly stated, the system claims no hearing specialists were found when the RAG documents don't contain any hearing specialists at all - making this a misleading statement. The phone number 1-800-555-TOGL is completely fabricated and not found anywhere in the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-555-TOGL (8645)' not found in RAG documents
     - Misleading statement about 'couldn't find any hearing specialists' when RAG documents contain no hearing specialists to begin with
     - No acknowledgment that the knowledge base may not contain hearing specialists
     - Suggests expanding search area without any basis in the provided RAG context

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is clear, well-structured, and professional with good use of formatting to organize information. However, there are minor issues including an inconsistent greeting format using the full name with number, and some sections could be more concise to improve readability.
   Issues:
     - Greeting uses full name including number '5' which appears unnatural
     - Could be more concise - some bullet points contain multiple concepts that could be separated
     - Phone number format uses non-standard placeholder that may confuse customers

   **⚠️ Important HMO Requirement:**
   Since you're on an HMO plan, you'll need a referral from your Primary Care Physician to see any specialist, including a rheumatologist. This is a requirement of your plan.
   
   **Here's what I recommend:**
   
   1. **Contact your PCP** for a referral to an in-network rheumatologist. They may have access to rheumatologists in our network who aren't showing in my current search.
   2. **Call Member Services** at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 for a complete, up-to-date rheumatology provider search.

   Reasoning: The system provided a complete response about claim appeals and appointment scheduling, but there are no RAG documents available to verify any of this information. All content appears to be generated without grounding in retrieved knowledge base documents.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents provided as source of truth

The bullet points effectively organize complex information, and the call-to-action is direct.

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While emergency coverage is mentioned in the RAG context, the specific details provided (70% coverage, coinsurance structure, no pre-authorization) are not found in the retrieved documents for the user's Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - Claims '70% coverage after copay with 30% coinsurance' - this percentage is only mentioned for Silver EPO plan, not Gold HMO
     - States 'Plan pays 70% of eligible expenses' without RAG document support for Gold HMO plan
     - Mentions 'out-of-pocket maximum' without any such details in RAG documents for Gold HMO
     - Provides detailed coverage structure not found in retrieved knowledge base documents
     - RAG documents only show '$350 Emergency Room Visit' copay for Gold HMO but lack other coverage details cited in response

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex insurance information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all key coverage details are explained in accessible language. Minor deduction for a few instances where slightly more precise language could eliminate any potential ambiguity.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'eligible expenses' could be briefly clarified since customers may not know what qualifies
     - The transition between emergency and non-emergency coverage could be slightly smoother

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (Policy ID: TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), emergency care is covered even when you're traveling. 
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   * Emergency services are covered both in-network and out-of-network.
   * Your copay for an Emergency Room Visit is $350.
   * After the copay, the plan covers 70% of the eligible expenses, and you're responsible for the remaining 30% coinsurance until you meet your out-of-pocket maximum.
   
   Some important details to keep in mind:
   * Emergency care is covered without the need for pre-authorization.
   * While emergency services are covered out-of-network, other non-emergency services received outside the HMO Network may not be covered.
   * It's always a good idea to check your plan documents or contact us if you have specific questions about your coverage when traveling.
   
   If you need further assistance or have more questions about your coverage, feel free to ask, or I can recommend speaking with a human agent for more personalized help.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   Great question! Yes, emergency care is covered when you're traveling, and I'm glad you asked so you know exactly what to expect.
   
   **Here's what your Gold HMO plan covers:**
   
   - **Emergency services are covered in-network AND out-of-network** (so you're protected no matter where you are)
   - **$350 copay** for an Emergency Room visit
   - **Plan pays 70%** of eligible expenses after your copay, and you cover the remaining 30% coinsurance until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum
   - **No pre-authorization needed** — you can go straight to the ER
   
   **Important to know:**
   
   While emergency care is covered everywhere, keep in mind that **non-emergency services outside our HMO Network may not be covered**. So if you need follow-up or routine care while traveling, try to use in-network providers when possible.
   
   **Before you travel**, it's a smart idea to grab your member ID card and keep our contact info handy. If anything comes up and you're unsure about coverage for a specific situation, just reach out to us — we're here to help.
   
   Do you have any other questions about traveling with your coverage, or is there anything else I can help clarify?
   
   Best,

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The output contains a critical factual error regarding Dr. Gary Wilson's network status. The RAG documents clearly show he is in TH-HMO-PRIMARY network and accepts TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plans, but the output incorrectly states he is out-of-network for the user's Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - Incorrectly states Dr. Gary Wilson is out-of-network when RAG shows he accepts TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 and is in TH-HMO-PRIMARY network
     - Lists only EPO, HDHP, and PPO plans as accepted, omitting the critical TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan from RAG data
     - Provides misleading guidance about needing PCP referral and higher costs based on incorrect network status

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it thoroughly addresses the customer's needs while providing clear next steps. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in explaining HMO requirements.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I searched for gastroenterologists in San Francisco and found that there are gastroenterology providers in your area, but unfortunately, the one I found is not in-network for your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan.
   
   **Out-of-Network Provider Found:**
   
   **Dr. Gary D. Wilson, MD**
   - Specialty: Gastroenterology

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output makes several claims about prescription drug coverage and copays that are not supported by the RAG documents. While the Diabetes Management Program information is accurately cited, the core question about insulin coverage cannot be answered from the provided documents, yet the system provides specific guidance as if this information exists.
   Issues:
     - Claims insulin is covered with 'different copay levels based on medication tier' but RAG documents only mention 'Prescription Drug Copays - Gold HMO' without any actual copay details or tier information
     - References 'Prescription Drug Copays documentation' and 'formulary' that are not present in the RAG context
     - Provides specific guidance to 'check plan's formulary to determine tier' when no formulary information exists in source documents
     - Makes definitive statements about coverage structure without supporting evidence from RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, your insulin coverage is detailed under the Prescription Drug Copays section. 
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   * Your plan covers prescription medications, including insulin, at various copay levels depending on the medication tier.
   * The specific copay for insulin depends on whether it's classified as a generic, preferred brand, or non-preferred brand medication.
   * You can find the exact copay information in your plan's Prescription Drug Copays documentation.
   
   To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about your insulin coverage:
   1. Check your plan's Prescription Drug Copays documentation on the ToggleHealth website or mobile app.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.70

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant factual errors regarding Dr. Murphy's network coverage. The RAG documents clearly state he accepts TH-EPO-SELECT and TH-PPO-PREMIER networks with plans TH-EPO-SILVER-2024 and TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024, but the user has TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan which is NOT listed as accepted by Dr. Murphy.
   Issues:
     - Recommends Dr. Murphy as 'IN-NETWORK' when RAG shows he only accepts TH-EPO-SELECT and TH-PPO-PREMIER networks, not the user's HMO Network
     - States Dr. Murphy accepts TH-EPO-SILVER-2024 and TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024 plans but user has TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 which is not listed in his accepted plans
     - Misleading recommendation since the provider would actually be out-of-network for this HMO member

📊 Coherence: 0.70 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is generally clear and well-structured with good use of formatting and logical flow. However, there are some coherence issues including contradictory network information (states user has HMO but shows EPO/PPO networks for the provider) and incomplete explanation of why no hand surgeons were found despite showing an orthopedic surgeon.
   Issues:
     - Contradictory network information - user has HMO coverage but recommended provider shows EPO/PPO networks only
     - Incomplete explanation of search results - claims no hand surgeons found but doesn't explain search parameters or geographic limitations
     - Plan compatibility unclear - recommended provider's accepted plans don't match user's Gold HMO plan

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects most information from the RAG documents, correctly stating 80% coverage after deductible, preauthorization requirements, and referral needs for MRIs. However, it lacks a specific copay amount that wasn't provided in the retrieved documents for diagnostic imaging.
   Issues:
     - No specific copay amount mentioned - RAG documents show diagnostic tests have 80% coverage after deductible but don't specify a flat copay for MRIs
     - Cost example assumes deductible is met without mentioning this assumption clearly

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, logical flow, and comprehensive information. The language is professional yet accessible, with medical terms appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in formatting could potentially create slight ambiguity for some readers.
   Issues:
     - Mixed formatting styles (bullets vs numbered lists) could be slightly confusing
     - The cost example could be clearer about when deductible applies vs doesn't apply

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects the RAG document information about preventive care coverage. All key facts are correctly stated: 100% coverage, no deductible applies, no annual limit, and must use in-network providers. The response properly includes the network requirement (TH-HMO-PRIMARY) and contact information from the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The response doesn't explicitly mention 'no cost sharing' terminology used in the RAG documents, though the meaning is conveyed through '100% coverage with no cost to you'

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all key points are addressed comprehensively. Minor stylistic variations in bullet point formatting could create slight visual inconsistency.
   Issues:
     - Mixed bullet point styles (some with bold headers, others without) could create minor visual inconsistency

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output correctly identifies the copay amounts for brand name drugs from the RAG documents (Preferred Brand $35/$70 and Non-Preferred Brand $70/$140). However, it includes information about '90% coverage after deductible' which appears to be from a different plan (Platinum PPO) rather than the user's Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - The statement about 'plan pays 90% of additional costs after deductible' appears to be from the Platinum PPO document rather than the Gold HMO plan information

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with effective use of formatting to present complex insurance information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are appropriately contextualized. Minor deduction for the placeholder '[Your Name]' which slightly undermines the personalized feel.
   Issues:
     - Placeholder '[Your Name]' instead of actual representative name reduces personalization

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations not found in the RAG documents. The response fabricates specific phone numbers (1-800-TOGGLE-1), website URLs (my.togglehealth.com/find-provider), business hours, and detailed procedural information about referrals that are not present in the retrieved knowledge base documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' and business hours 'Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT' not found in RAG documents
     - Invented website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, logical flow, and professional tone. The information is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of finding a hand therapist with HMO coverage. Minor stylistic variations include the placeholder '[Your Name]' which could create slight confusion about who is responding.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be transparent with you:
   
   **I wasn't able to find any hand therapists in Boston in my current provider database.**
   
   The search results I have access to include various specialists in Boston (dermatology, endocrinology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, oncology, and others), but unfortunately, hand therapy specialists are not listed.
   
   ## Here's what I recommend:
   
   **Since you have an HMO Gold plan, you'll need a referral from your Primary Care Physician to see a specialist.** I see you already have a PCP assigned, which is great!
   
   **Next steps:**
   1. **Contact your PCP** to request a referral for hand therapy services

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects the diagnostic test coverage information from the RAG documents, correctly stating 80% coverage after deductible, preauthorization requirements for advanced imaging, and no annual limits. However, it omits the important detail that all services must use in-network providers from the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network.
   Issues:
     - Missing critical requirement that lab tests must be performed by in-network providers from TH-HMO-PRIMARY network
     - Does not mention the specific network restriction which is essential for HMO coverage

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is generally clear and well-structured with good use of bullet points and formatting. However, there are some inconsistencies between the coverage description and the bullet points that could create confusion for the customer.
   Issues:
     - Inconsistency between stating 'lab test coverage' in opening but then mixing lab tests with imaging services throughout
     - The bullet point about 'Includes: X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and lab work' contradicts the preauthorization note about advanced imaging
     - Could be clearer about distinguishing between basic lab work and advanced imaging requirements

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), lab tests are covered under the Diagnostic Tests category. 
   
   * Coverage: 80% after deductible
   * Deductible: Yes
   * Preauthorization Required: Yes, for advanced imaging (MRI, CT, PET scans)
   * Annual Limit: None
   * Includes: X-rays, MRI, CT scans, lab work
   
   This means that you will need to pay your deductible first, and then the plan will cover 80% of the eligible lab test costs. You will be responsible for the remaining 20%. 
   
   It's also important to note that while lab tests are covered, advanced imaging services like MRI, CT, and PET scans require preauthorization. Your healthcare provider will typically handle this process for you. 
   
   To confirm the specific details of your coverage or to check if a particular lab test requires preauthorization, you can contact Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 or visit my.togglehealth.com for more information.

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey Williams 17,
   
   Thanks for reaching out with your question about lab test coverage.
   
   Here's what your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024) includes for lab tests:
   
   - **Coverage**: 80% after you meet your deductible
   - **Deductible**: Yes, you'll need to pay this first
   - **Preauthorization Required**: Yes, for advanced imaging like MRI, CT, and PET scans
   - **Annual Limit**: None
   - **Includes**: X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and lab work
   
   This means you'll pay your deductible upfront, and then the plan will cover 80% of the eligible lab test costs. You'll be responsible for the remaining 20%.
   
   **Important Note**: While most lab tests are covered, advanced imaging services like MRI, CT, and PET scans require preauthorization. Your healthcare provider will usually handle this for you.
   
   If you need to confirm the specifics of your coverage or check if a particular lab test requires preauthorization, you can reach Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 or visit [my.togglehealth.com](http://my.togglehealth.com) for more information.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response correctly identifies that no urologists are found in the RAG documents and accurately lists the available Houston specialists with their correct specialties. All provider information mentioned (Dr. Garcia for Gastroenterology, Dr. Susan E. Nguyen for Oncology, etc.) matches the RAG documents exactly. The plan acceptance (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024) is correctly verified against the RAG data.
   Issues:
     - Contact information (phone number, website URLs) and member services details are not found in the RAG documents and appear to be hallucinated
     - PCP assignment claim is not verified in the provided RAG context

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear sections, professional tone, and actionable next steps. However, there are some minor clarity issues with the specialist list presentation and a slightly confusing statement about the PCP assignment that could create ambiguity for the customer.
   Issues:
     - The specialist list format could be clearer - showing only specialty names without context may confuse customers about relevance
     - The statement 'you're all set for specialist referrals' followed by 'Your PCP can also provide urologist referrals if needed' creates slight redundancy and potential confusion about the referral process

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output makes multiple claims about insulin coverage that are not supported by the RAG documents. The RAG context contains no information about prescription drug benefits, copays, formularies, or pharmacy networks for the Gold HMO plan. The response fabricates details about insulin being covered, copay structures, and network pharmacy requirements.
   Issues:
     - Claims insulin is covered under prescription drug benefits - no prescription drug coverage information found in RAG documents
     - States there will be copays for insulin - no prescription drug copay information provided in RAG context
     - Mentions formulary requirements and prior authorization - no formulary information in RAG documents
     - References in-network pharmacy requirements - no pharmacy network information in RAG context
     - Provides Member Services number 1-800-TOGGLE-1 which appears in RAG but inappropriately used for prescription drug inquiries when no drug coverage info exists

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow from coverage confirmation to specific details to next steps. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are well-explained. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in coverage confirmation and one potentially confusing pronoun reference.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy in stating insulin coverage twice in opening sections
     - Pronoun 'it' in formulary section could be clearer (refers to insulin but follows 'list of covered drugs')

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.92, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.92 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key information about claims submission is correctly extracted from the source documents, including the fact that in-network providers file claims directly, out-of-network limitations for Gold HMO, required documentation, submission methods, and the 365-day deadline. Contact information and copay amounts are accurate.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: Could have mentioned that claim forms can be downloaded from my.togglehealth.com or requested by calling 1-800-TOGGLE-1, as stated in the RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it directly addresses the customer's needs while providing comprehensive guidance. Minor deduction for the placeholder '[Your Name]' which slightly undermines the personalized feel.
   Issues:
     - Placeholder '[Your Name]' at the end should be replaced with actual representative name

   # How to Submit a Claim
   
   Based on your **Gold HMO plan**, here's what you need to know about claims:
   
   ## Good News: You Likely Don't Need to Submit Claims
   
   Since you have a Gold HMO plan, **in-network providers file claims directly with ToggleHealth for you**. You simply pay your copay at the time of service, and the provider handles the rest.
   
   **You're responsible for:**
   - Copays ($25 for primary care, $45 for specialists, etc.)
   - Your deductible (until met)
   - Coinsurance (your percentage of costs after deductible)
   
   ## If You Do Need to Submit a Claim
   
   The only time you'd need to file a claim yourself is if you received care from an **out-of-network provider**. However, with your Gold HMO plan, out-of-network services are generally **not covered** (except for true emergencies).
   
   **If you have an out-of-network claim to submit:**
   
   1. **Gather documentation:**
      - Itemized bill or receipt (not just a credit card receipt)
      - Provider name and tax ID number
      - Date of service
      - Your Member ID: **TH-HMO-GOLD-2024**
   
   2. **Submit via:**
      - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/submit-claim
      - **Mail:** ToggleHealth Claims Department, PO Box 98234, Seattle, WA 98109
      - **Fax:** 1-206-555-0198
   
   3. **Important deadline:** Submit within **365 days** of the date of service
   
   ## Need Help?
   
   **Call Member Services:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   - **Hours:** Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 8 PM Pacific
   - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/claims
   
   Is there a specific claim or service you're asking about? I'm happy to help clarify your coverage.

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains major factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The user has a Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), but all retrieved documents contain cost-sharing information for PPO Platinum plans (TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024), which are completely different plan types with different coverage structures.
   Issues:
     - Claims Gold HMO covers 'in-network hospital stays' but RAG documents only contain PPO Platinum plan information, not Gold HMO coverage details
     - States 'I don't have your plan's specific deductible amount' when RAG documents show specific deductibles ($500/$1,500 individual) - though for wrong plan type
     - Mentions 'copay or coinsurance' structure without any supporting evidence from RAG documents for Gold HMO plans
     - Provides general advice about checking policy documents and calling support instead of using the available cost-sharing data from RAG documents
     - Fails to acknowledge the plan type mismatch between user's Gold HMO and the retrieved PPO Platinum documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity with well-structured sections, professional yet friendly tone, and comprehensive coverage of the topic. The use of clear headings and bullet points makes complex insurance information easily digestible for the customer.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation in section headers (mixing 'The Good News' with 'Here's How Costs Typically Work') could be slightly more consistent

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To provide an accurate estimate for your hospital stay costs, I'll need to review the details of your Gold HMO plan.
   
   Based on your policy information (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), here are the relevant coverage details:
   
   * In-network hospital stays are covered under your plan.
   * Your plan has the following cost-sharing components:
     • Annual Deductible: Not explicitly stated for TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, but for a similar plan (TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024), it's $500 Individual/$1,000 Family.
     • Coinsurance Rate: Not explicitly stated for TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, but for a similar plan (TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024), it's 10% (Plan pays 90%).
     • Copays for Medical Visits: Available for Gold HMO, but specific hospital stay copays are not provided in the available policy information.
   
   Since the exact deductible and coinsurance rate for your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan are not available in the provided policy information, I'll provide a general outline of how hospital stay costs are typically calculated:
   
   1. You'll typically pay a copay or coinsurance rate for hospital stays.
   2. If your hospital stay is in-network, you'll generally pay less than if it were out-of-network.
   3. Your annual deductible may apply to your hospital stay costs.
   
   To get a more accurate estimate, I recommend checking your policy documents or contacting our customer support directly. They can provide you with the specific details related to your plan, including any applicable copays, deductibles, or coinsurance rates.
   
   If you'd like to proceed with getting a more detailed estimate or have further questions, I can offer the following next steps:
   * Review your policy documents for specific hospital stay coverage details.
   * Contact our customer support team for personalized assistance.
   * Discuss your options with your healthcare provider to understand the estimated costs.
   
   Please let me know how I can further assist you.

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Riley,
   
   Thanks for asking about hospital stay costs—it's smart to plan ahead!
   
   Here's what I can tell you about your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024):
   
   **The Good News:**
   Your plan covers in-network hospital stays, which means you'll pay less than you would out-of-network.
   
   **Here's How Costs Typically Work:**
   - You'll pay either a copay or coinsurance (a percentage of the bill) for your hospital stay
   - Your annual deductible may apply before coverage kicks in
   - Staying in-network keeps your out-of-pocket costs down
   
   **The Honest Part:**
   I don't have your plan's specific deductible amount, coinsurance percentage, or exact hospital copay in front of me right now—so I can't give you a precise dollar figure without digging deeper.
   
   **Here's What I'd Recommend:**

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The output contains a critical factual error regarding Dr. Lisa E. Brown's network coverage. According to the RAG documents, Dr. Brown is NOT in the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network and does NOT accept TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plans, yet the output incorrectly states she is 'In-Network' for the user's Gold HMO plan. This is a significant healthcare coverage misrepresentation that could lead to unexpected costs.
   Issues:
     - Dr. Lisa E. Brown is incorrectly listed as 'In-Network' when RAG documents show she only accepts TH-EPO-SELECT, TH-HDHP-CORE, and TH-PPO-PREMIER networks, not TH-HMO-PRIMARY which is required for the user's TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan
     - Only Dr. Ashley C. Rodriguez should have been recommended as she is the only family medicine doctor in Portland who accepts TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 according to the RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for very slight informality in 'Great news!' opening.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key information about maternity care coverage (prenatal visit copays of $25, delivery copay of $500, 80% coverage after deductible) is correctly stated from the source documents. The Maternity Support Program details are accurately presented, including automatic enrollment, 24/7 nurse hotline, 100% covered prenatal vitamins, free breast pump, and postpartum support. The note about no referral needed for OB/GYN care is also correctly derived from the RAG content.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with well-organized sections, clear headings, and comprehensive coverage information. The tone is professional yet friendly, appropriate for healthcare customer service. Minor areas for improvement include some technical details that could benefit from brief explanations.
   Issues:
     - The term 'deductible' appears multiple times without explanation for customers who may be unfamiliar
     - The network name 'TH-HMO-PRIMARY' is mentioned only once at the end without prior context

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.60

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains major factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The system claims no hearing specialists were found in San Diego, but the RAG documents don't contain any hearing specialists at all - they only list dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, mental health providers, pharmacies, and primary care physicians. The response then fabricates member services contact information and suggests Dr. Emily G. Nguyen as a 'related specialist' when neurology is not related to hearing issues.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'no hearing specialists found' when RAG documents contain no hearing specialists to begin with
     - Fabricates member services contact information not present in RAG documents
     - Incorrectly suggests neurologist Dr. Emily G. Nguyen as 'related' to hearing issues when neurology is unrelated to audiology/hearing
     - Provides accurate provider details for Dr. Nguyen but misrepresents the relevance to user's hearing specialist request

📊 Coherence: 0.60 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response has clear structure and professional tone, but contains significant logical inconsistencies that would confuse customers. The main issue is recommending a neurologist for hearing problems without explanation, and contradicting the initial statement about no available specialists.
   Issues:
     - Contradicts initial statement by providing a specialist after saying none were found
     - Recommends neurologist for hearing issues without explaining the connection
     - Placeholder text '[member services contact info]' instead of actual contact information
     - Logical flow is disrupted by the unexplained specialist recommendation

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output contains major factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While the RAG context shows multiple specialists in Houston that accept the user's TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan, the system incorrectly states 'I couldn't find any urologists' and then provides unrelated specialists as alternatives. Most critically, the system fabricates contact information (website URLs, phone numbers) and policy details about HMO referral requirements that are not found anywhere in the RAG documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims no urologists available when RAG documents don't contain urologist data - should state this directly rather than implying search was performed
     - Fabricates website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not found in RAG documents
     - Fabricates phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Fabricates HMO referral requirement policy not mentioned in RAG documents
     - Suggests contacting assigned PCP when RAG documents don't contain PCP assignment details for this user

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive information. Minor deduction for the slight disconnect between apologizing for no urologists while immediately providing related specialists, which could momentarily confuse customers about what's actually available.
   Issues:
     - Minor logical flow issue - apologizes for no urologists but immediately lists specialists, creating brief confusion about availability

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations and fails to provide accurate information based on the RAG documents. The retrieved documents do not contain any specific information about X-ray copays for Gold HMO plans, yet the system provides detailed guidance and claims knowledge about coverage that isn't supported by the source material.
   Issues:
     - Claims Gold HMO plan covers diagnostic services when RAG documents contain no Gold HMO diagnostic coverage information
     - States X-rays are 'typically covered as diagnostic imaging' without any supporting evidence in RAG documents
     - Provides detailed procedural guidance (check member materials, contact services, verify with provider) not found in retrieved documents
     - References member services contact info and specific plan features not present in RAG context
     - Makes assertions about in-network requirements and coverage specifics without factual basis from source documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with logical flow from greeting to specific information to actionable next steps. The tone is professional yet friendly, and complex information is broken down effectively using headers and bullet points. Minor stylistic variation in the closing could be slightly more consistent with the professional tone established throughout.

   I appreciate your question, Parker. I can see you have our **Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024)**, but I don't have the specific X-ray copay information in the policy details currently available to me.
   
   Here's what I can tell you:
   - Your plan includes **in-network diagnostic services** as part of your Gold HMO coverage
   - X-rays are typically covered as diagnostic imaging when ordered by your primary care provider
   
   **To get your exact X-ray copay amount, I recommend:**
   1. **Check your member materials** - Your plan documents or member ID card should list diagnostic imaging copays
   2. **Contact our member services team** - They can provide the specific copay amount and any conditions (like whether prior authorization is needed)
   3. **Verify with your provider** - When you schedule, ask if the facility is in-network and confirm the copay before your visit
   
   Since you're in San Francisco and have preferred providers assigned, make sure any imaging facility is part of our HMO Network to get your best rate.
   
   Would you like me to help you with anything else about your coverage, or would you prefer to speak with a member services representative who can give you the exact copay amount?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects the RAG document content by correctly stating no hematologists were found and providing accurate details for Dr. Ashley E. Patel (oncologist). All provider information matches the source documents exactly, including contact details, network status, and ratings.
   Issues:
     - Response adds helpful guidance about PCP referrals and Member Services contact information that is not present in the RAG documents, though this appears to be standard healthcare navigation advice rather than fabricated policy details

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in explaining HMO referral process.

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately presents information directly from the RAG documents for both internal medicine doctors in Minneapolis. All provider details (names, addresses, phone numbers, provider IDs, languages, ratings, and network information) match exactly with the source documents. The system correctly identified that both doctors accept the user's TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately contextualized. Minor deduction for a small inconsistency in the recommendation count (says 'I'd suggest reaching out to 1 or 2 of them' when only 2 options were provided).

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key coverage details are correctly stated: 80% coverage after deductible, $45 copay per session, no annual limit, and in-network requirement. The response correctly notes no referral is needed for mental health therapy and accurately provides the network size (1,243 providers) and contact information.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The response states 'no referral required' for mental health therapy, but the RAG documents don't explicitly confirm this exception for mental health services under Gold HMO, though it's implied by the specialist care section requiring referrals generally

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow. The language is professional yet friendly, and complex insurance terms are explained clearly. Minor stylistic variations in formatting (mix of bold and regular text) could create very slight visual inconsistency.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The output correctly identifies that vision care is excluded except for eye exams, which aligns with the RAG document stating 'Vision care (except for eye exams)' in the exclusions section. However, it fails to provide specific coverage details for eye exams that should be available from the policy documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'Specific copay amounts and frequency limits aren't detailed in your available policy information' when the RAG documents should contain this information for covered services
     - Does not specify whether eye exams require PCP referral, deductible application, or coinsurance rates that would typically be documented for covered services
     - Lacks precision about what constitutes covered 'eye exams' versus excluded 'vision care'

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it fully addresses the customer's needs with clear next steps.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), your vision care coverage is limited. The plan specifically excludes vision care except for eye exams.
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   * Eye exams are covered under your plan, but details about copays or frequency limits are not specified in the available policy information.
   * Other vision care services, such as glasses, contacts, or vision correction surgery, are not covered under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   To get more specific information about eye exam coverage, including any associated costs or limitations, you have a few options:
   1. Check the provider directory on my.togglehealth.com to find in-network eye care professionals.
   2. Contact Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 to ask about eye exam coverage details.
   3. Review your policy documents or the ToggleHealth Mobile app for more information.
   
   If you're considering vision care services beyond eye exams, you may want to explore separate vision insurance options or discuss potential out-of-pocket costs with your provider.
   
   Would you like help finding in-network eye care professionals or more information about your plan's coverage?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   Thanks for asking about vision coverage—it's a common question, and I'm happy to clarify what your Gold HMO plan includes.
   
   **Here's the quick answer:** Your plan covers eye exams, but not glasses, contacts, or vision correction surgery.
   
   **What's covered:**
   - Eye exams are included in your plan
   - Specific copay amounts and frequency limits aren't detailed in your available policy information
   
   **What's NOT covered:**
   - Glasses
   - Contact lenses
   - Vision correction surgery (like LASIK)
   
   **Next steps if you need vision care:**
   
   If you're planning an eye exam, I'd recommend checking the provider directory on my.togglehealth.com to find in-network eye care professionals in San Francisco. You can also contact Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 if you want details about any copays or visit limits for eye exams.
   
   For glasses, contacts, or other vision services, you'd be looking at out-of-pocket costs. Many people find it helpful to explore separate vision insurance options if these services are important to you—our Member Services team can discuss options with you too.
   
   Would it help if I find in-network eye care providers near you in San Francisco, or do you have other questions about your coverage?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The output correctly identifies two family medicine providers from the RAG documents with accurate details (names, addresses, phone numbers, ratings, network status). However, it includes Dr. Richard D. Miller who practices Internal Medicine, not Family Medicine as requested, and fails to mention Dr. Lisa E. Brown who is a Family Medicine doctor but not in the HMO network.
   Issues:
     - Included Dr. Richard D. Miller (Internal Medicine) instead of focusing solely on Family Medicine specialists as requested
     - Did not mention Dr. Lisa E. Brown, MD (Family Medicine) who is available but not in HMO network - this omission could be important for user decision-making
     - All provider details (addresses, phones, ratings, years of practice) are accurately pulled from RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive information. The use of headers, bullet points, and emojis enhances readability while maintaining professionalism. Minor deduction for the slight ambiguity around the user's current PCP status and whether they're switching or adding a provider.
   Issues:
     - Minor ambiguity about whether user is switching PCPs or adding a provider - could be clarified earlier in response

      - Practice: Portland Family Medicine

   **2. Dr. Richard D. Miller, DO**

   **Note:** Dr. Miller practices Internal Medicine, which provides similar primary care services to Family Medicine but typically focuses on adult patients.
   
   **Next Steps:**
   - I recommend contacting both providers to check availability
   - Ask about appointment wait times and scheduling preferences
   - Both are highly rated and accepting new patients
   - Since you already have a PCP assigned, you may want to verify if you're looking to switch or add a provider
   
   Would you like more information about either of these providers, or should I search with different criteria?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key coverage details are correctly stated: $35 copay, 80% coverage after deductible (correctly presented as 20% patient responsibility), 20 visits annual limit, and PCP referral requirement. The response properly emphasizes the critical HMO requirement for referrals and in-network providers.
   Issues:
     - Minor presentation issue: The response lists 'Copay: $35 per session' and 'Coinsurance: You pay 20% after deductible' as separate items, which could be slightly confusing since the RAG document indicates 80% coverage after deductible WITH a $35 copay per session, suggesting the copay may be instead of coinsurance rather than in addition to it.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional tone. The information is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the user's likely needs. Minor deduction for a slightly complex cost example that could potentially confuse some customers.
   Issues:
     - The cost example in the final section combines copay and coinsurance concepts which might be confusing for some customers to calculate

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, **yes, chiropractic care is covered**.
   
   Here are the specific coverage details for your plan:
   
   **Chiropractic Care Coverage:**
   • **Coverage:** 80% after deductible (you pay 20%)
   • **Copay:** $35 per session
   • **Annual Limit:** 20 visits per year
   • **Referral Required:** YES - you must get a referral from your Primary Care Physician (PCP)
   
   **Important Requirements:**
   • You must see an in-network chiropractor from the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network
   • A referral from your PCP is required before your first visit
   • Without a referral, the visits will not be covered
   
   **How to Get Started:**
   1. Schedule an appointment with your assigned PCP
   2. Discuss your need for chiropractic care
   3. Your PCP will evaluate and provide a referral if appropriate
   4. Find an in-network chiropractor using the provider directory at my.togglehealth.com
   5. Schedule your appointment with the chiropractor
   
   **Cost Example:**
   If a chiropractic session costs $100, you would pay the $35 copay plus 20% of the remaining amount after your deductible is met.
   
   Since you're assigned a PCP with your HMO plan, I recommend starting there to discuss your chiropractic care needs and obtain the necessary referral. You can find your PCP information in your member portal or by calling Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately acknowledges that no OB/GYN providers are found in the RAG documents, which contain only other specialties (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, etc.) in San Diego. The system correctly identifies the user's Gold HMO plan and mentions the PCP assignment requirement, which aligns with HMO network structure.
   Issues:
     - Contact information (phone number, website URLs) and specific member services details are not found in the RAG documents and appear to be hallucinated
     - The response adds helpful context about HMO referral requirements that isn't explicitly stated in the retrieved documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with logical flow from problem acknowledgment to actionable solutions. The tone is professional yet friendly, and complex insurance concepts are explained appropriately. Minor stylistic variations in formatting could potentially create slight visual inconsistency.

   I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be transparent with you:
   
   **I wasn't able to find any OB/GYN providers in the search results available to me.**
   
   The provider database I have access to contains specialists in San Diego (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurology) and mental health providers, but unfortunately **no Obstetrics/Gynecology specialists are listed**.
   
   ## Here's what I recommend:
   
   **Option 1: Contact ToggleHealth Member Services**

   - For specialist visits like OB/GYN, your PCP can provide a referral if needed
   - This helps ensure in-network coverage

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=1.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is completely accurate and grounded in the RAG documents. It correctly states that acupuncture is not covered under the Gold HMO plan, which is explicitly listed in the exclusions section. All alternative coverage options mentioned (physical therapy, chiropractic care, telemedicine) are accurately described with correct copays, coverage percentages, and requirements as stated in the source documents.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in formatting (bold vs. non-bold text) could create slight visual inconsistency.
   Issues:
     - Inconsistent formatting with some items bolded and others not within the same section
     - Minor redundancy in mentioning 'after deductible' twice for similar services

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), **acupuncture is not covered**.
   
   This service is specifically listed in your plan's exclusions. Your Gold HMO plan does not provide benefits for acupuncture treatments.
   
   **What this means for you:**
   - If you receive acupuncture, you would be responsible for paying the full cost out of pocket
   - Your plan will not reimburse any portion of acupuncture expenses
   
   **Alternative options you might consider:**
   Your plan *does* cover some related services that may help with pain management or wellness:
   - **Physical Therapy** - 80% coverage after deductible, $35 copay per session (up to 60 visits/year) - requires PCP referral
   - **Chiropractic Care** - 80% coverage after deductible, $35 copay per session (up to 20 visits/year) - requires PCP referral
   - **Telemedicine consultations** - $0 copay, available 24/7 if you want to discuss pain management options
   
   **Next steps:**
   If you're interested in exploring covered alternatives for your health needs, I'd recommend:
   1. Speaking with your primary care physician about what treatment options are covered under your plan
   2. Calling Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 if you have questions about your coverage
   
   Is there anything else about your plan's covered services I can help clarify?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response correctly identifies and presents accurate provider information from the RAG documents, including correct provider IDs, contact details, network status, and ratings for both Dr. White (dermatology) and Dr. Thompson (orthopedic surgery). However, the system fails to acknowledge that no dedicated wound care specialists were found in the retrieved documents, instead making assumptions about dermatologists handling wound care without explicit support from the RAG content.
   Issues:
     - Claims dermatologists 'often treat chronic wounds and skin-related wound issues' without this being stated in RAG documents
     - Claims orthopedic surgeons 'may treat surgical wounds and trauma-related wounds' without RAG document support
     - Recommends starting with Dr. White for wound care without explicit wound care services mentioned in his provider profile
     - Suggests calling Member Services with phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' which is not found in the RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive information. It effectively addresses the customer's need while explaining why exact matches weren't found and providing logical alternatives. The only minor issue is the slightly lengthy format that could potentially overwhelm some customers.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations not found in the RAG documents. The system fabricated contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1), website URLs, mobile app references, and specific HMO requirements like referrals and pre-authorization that are not mentioned anywhere in the retrieved documents. The RAG context contains no dental providers, which the output correctly identifies, but then provides completely fabricated guidance.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Invented website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not in source material
     - Created mobile app reference with GPS features not mentioned in RAG context
     - Added HMO referral and pre-authorization requirements not stated in retrieved documents
     - Mentioned 'dental rider' and separate dental benefits without RAG support
     - Provided specific business hours and contact methods not found in source documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, logical flow, and professional tone. The language is accessible while maintaining healthcare industry standards, and it provides comprehensive next steps and coverage information.
   Issues:
     - Minor inconsistency in addressing the customer as 'Avery Jones 38' instead of just 'Avery' which could seem impersonal

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I searched for dentists in San Francisco but didn't find any pediatric dentists or general dentists in your area in our current provider directory.
   
   **What I Found Instead:**
   The search returned various medical specialists (dermatology, endocrinology, etc.) and primary care physicians, but no dental providers that would be appropriate for your child's needs.
   
   **Your Options:**
   
   1. **Contact Member Services for Dental Directory:**
      - Call: 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
      - Visit: my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
      - Use the ToggleHealth Mobile app for GPS-enabled search
   
   2. **Important HMO Information:**
      Since you have a Gold HMO plan, dental services may require:
      - Referral from your Primary Care Physician
      - Pre-authorization for certain procedures
      - Specific in-network dental providers
   
   3. **Verify Coverage:**
      Your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan may have separate dental benefits or require a dental rider. Member Services can clarify:
      - What dental services are covered
      - If pediatric dental is included
      - Referral requirements
      - In-network pediatric dentists in San Francisco
   
   **Next Steps:**
   I recommend calling Member Services first to understand your dental coverage and get a current list of in-network pediatric dentists in the San Francisco area. They can also help determine if you need a referral from your PCP before scheduling.
   
   Would you like me to help you find your Primary Care Physician's contact information, or do you have other questions about your coverage?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key information about the Heart Health Program (HHP-2024) is correctly stated, including monthly nurse hotline, 36 cardiac rehab sessions, free blood pressure monitor, and waived copays for cardiac specialists. Coverage details (80% after deductible) and enrollment methods are accurate.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: Could have mentioned that the Heart Health Program is specifically for members 'with cardiovascular disease' as stated in RAG docs, though this doesn't significantly impact accuracy for someone asking about heart disease programs

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow from program benefits to broader coverage to enrollment steps. The language is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for the slightly casual phrase 'Quick heads-up' which could be more professional in healthcare communication.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'Quick heads-up' is somewhat casual for healthcare customer service communication

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains some accurate information from RAG documents (emergency room copay of $350 for Gold HMO) but makes significant claims not found in the retrieved documents. The RAG context only mentions 'Emergency services only' for out-of-network coverage but provides no specific details about travel coverage or emergency care policies for the Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - Claims emergency services are covered 'even when you're out of network or traveling' - this specific travel coverage detail is not found in RAG documents
     - States 'non-emergency services received out-of-network are not covered except in emergencies' - while logical, this specific policy language is not in the RAG documents
     - Advises to 'try to seek emergency care from providers within your HMO network if possible' - this guidance is not supported by RAG content
     - Most information appears to be general healthcare knowledge rather than grounded in the specific policy documents provided

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is clear and well-structured with good use of formatting and bullet points. However, there are some minor ambiguities around 'non-emergency services' and 'except in emergencies' that could confuse customers about what exactly is covered when traveling.
   Issues:
     - Contradictory statement about non-emergency services 'not covered except in emergencies' creates confusion
     - The phrase 'if possible' regarding seeking in-network emergency care is vague and potentially misleading for true emergencies

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, emergency care is covered when traveling. Here are the specifics:
   
   - **Emergency Room Visit Copay:** $350

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While it correctly states there's no dedicated cancer support program and accurately cites some coverage details, it fabricates claims about 'excellent coverage for cancer-related care' and suggests the plan has 'various health management programs' for cancer when the RAG only documents three specific programs (Diabetes, Heart Health, Maternity) - none for cancer.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'excellent coverage for cancer-related care' - not stated in RAG documents
     - Suggests 'various health management programs' may be available for cancer - RAG only documents 3 specific programs (Diabetes, Heart Health, Maternity), none for cancer
     - Implies additional cancer support services may be available through Member Services without RAG documentation
     - Uses promotional language ('excellent coverage') not grounded in factual RAG content

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with well-organized sections, clear explanations of coverage details, and professional tone throughout. The formatting effectively uses headers and bullet points to make complex insurance information digestible for the customer.
   Issues:
     - Minor ambiguity in 'Various health management programs' section - could be more specific about what programs are available or how to access them

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, you are eligible for various special programs, including one that might be relevant to cancer support.
   
   While there isn't a specific "cancer support program" mentioned in your policy documents, your Gold HMO plan does include several benefits and programs that could be helpful if you're dealing with cancer or related health issues. Here are some relevant details:
   
   * Your plan covers various services that are typically relevant to cancer care, including:
     * Specialist care with a $45 copay per visit (after deductible)
     * Hospitalization at 80% coverage after a $500 per admission copay (after deductible)
     * Diagnostic tests (including advanced imaging like MRI, CT, PET) at 80% coverage (after deductible)
     * Durable Medical Equipment at 80% coverage (after deductible)
     * Home Health Care at 80% coverage (after deductible)
     * Hospice Care at 100% coverage (no deductible)
   
   * Your plan also includes access to Telemedicine Services through ToggleHealth Virtual Care at no additional copay. This could be useful for consultations related to cancer care.
   
   * While not specifically a cancer program, your plan offers various support programs that might be relevant depending on your specific situation:
     * Diabetes Management Program (if you have diabetes)
     * Heart Health Program (if you have cardiovascular disease)
     * Maternity Support Program (if you're pregnant)
   
   To get more specific information about cancer support or to inquire about potential additional resources, I recommend:
   1. Contacting your Primary Care Physician (PCP) for guidance on available support services.
   2. Calling Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 to ask about any cancer-related support programs or resources that might be available to you.
   3. Checking the ToggleHealth website or mobile app for any additional health management tools or resources.
   
   If you need more detailed information about your coverage or have specific questions about cancer treatment under your plan, I can help facilitate further inquiry.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output correctly states HMO referral requirements and acknowledges no colorectal surgeons were found, which aligns with the RAG documents that contain no colorectal surgeons. However, it makes a significant error by suggesting gastroenterologists as 'related specialists' when the RAG documents show Dr. Gary D. Wilson (SPEC-CA-023) is a gastroenterologist but NOT in the user's HMO network (TH-HMO-PRIMARY), only in TH-EPO-SELECT, TH-HDHP-CORE, and TH-PPO-PREMIER networks.
   Issues:
     - Suggests gastroenterologists as alternative without noting the available gastroenterologist (Dr. Wilson) is not covered under user's HMO network
     - Provides generic member services number (1-800-555-TOGGLE) not found in RAG documents
     - Does not mention specific in-network specialists that could potentially help with referrals

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting and logical flow. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it addresses the customer's needs comprehensively. Minor deduction for a very slight inconsistency in addressing the customer by their full name including age, which could feel impersonal.
   Issues:
     - Customer addressed as 'Casey Martinez 42' which includes age number and may feel impersonal rather than using just 'Casey'

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major hallucination by claiming no sleep specialists were found in the RAG documents, when in fact the RAG documents do not contain any sleep specialists - this is accurate. However, the response fabricates multiple pieces of information not found in the RAG documents including phone numbers (1-800-TOGGLE-1), websites (my.togglehealth.com), and specific HMO referral requirements that are not mentioned in the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Invented website 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in source documents
     - Added HMO referral requirement details not specified in the RAG context
     - Created mobile app reference and GPS features not documented in RAG
     - Suggested Dr. Linda G. O'Brien as neurologist when RAG shows her specialty as Neurology but doesn't establish connection to sleep medicine

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, headers, and bullet points. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it thoroughly addresses the customer's need while providing actionable next steps. Minor stylistic variations in formatting consistency could create very slight ambiguity.
   Issues:
     - Mixed formatting styles (some bullets use dashes, others use bullet points)
     - The phrase 'I want to be upfront with you' could be slightly more formal for healthcare communication

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I appreciate you providing all this detailed information, but I need to be direct with you:
   
   **I wasn't able to find any sleep specialists in Seattle in the available provider directory.**
   
   The provider database I have access to includes specialists in Seattle (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology), but unfortunately **Sleep Medicine/Sleep Specialists are not listed**.
   
   ## Here's what I recommend:
   
   **Option 1: Contact Member Services**
   They can help you find in-network sleep specialists:
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
   - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
   - **Mobile App:** Use GPS-enabled provider search
   
   **Option 2: Consider Related Specialists**
   Since you have an HMO plan, you'll need a **PCP referral** to see a specialist. Your options include:
   - **Dr. Linda G. O'Brien, MD - Neurology** (Provider ID: SPEC-WA-006)
     - Sleep disorders often have neurological components
     - Phone: 206-555-5012
     - ✓ IN-NETWORK | Accepting new patients
   
   **Important HMO Requirement:**
   ✓ Good news: You already have a Primary Care Physician assigned, so you can request a referral directly to a sleep specialist once we locate one.
   
   **Next Steps:**
   1. Call Member Services to get the current list of in-network sleep specialists
   2. Ask about wait times and new patient availability
   3. Request a referral from your PCP once you've selected a sleep specialist
   
   Would you like help with anything else, or would you like information about the Neurology specialist as an alternative?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Thanks for reaching out! I searched our provider directory for sleep specialists in Seattle, and I want to be upfront with you: **I wasn't able to find any sleep specialists currently listed in our system**.
   
   Here's what I found in our database for Seattle:
   - Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology specialists are available
   - Sleep Medicine specialists are not currently showing up

   - **Mobile App:** Use the GPS-enabled provider search to find specialists near you
   
   **Consider a Related Specialist in the Meantime**

   - **Dr. Linda G. O'Brien, MD - Neurology** (Provider ID: SPEC-WA-006)
     - Phone: 206-555-5012
     - ✓ In-network | Accepting new patients
   
   ## Important HMO Requirement:

   **Your next step:** Call Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 to get the current list of in-network sleep specialists in Seattle. They can also let you know about wait times and availability.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.92, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.92 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key information about claims submission is correctly extracted from the source documents, including the fact that in-network providers file claims directly, out-of-network claim procedures, required documentation, submission methods, and the 365-day deadline. The contact information and member-specific details are also accurate.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The response doesn't mention that Gold HMO generally doesn't cover out-of-network services except emergencies, which could be important context for the user to understand why they might need to file a claim

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, logical flow, and professional tone. The information is well-organized and addresses the customer's needs comprehensively. Minor stylistic variations in formatting and some technical details could potentially create very minor ambiguity for some customers.

   # How to Submit a Claim
   
   Based on your **Gold HMO plan**, here's what you need to know about claims:
   
   ## Good News: You Likely Don't Need to Submit Claims
   
   Since you have a Gold HMO plan, **in-network providers file claims directly with ToggleHealth for you**. You simply pay your copay at the time of service, and the provider handles the rest.
   
   **You're responsible for:**
   - Copays ($25 for primary care, $45 for specialists, etc.)
   - Your deductible (until it's met)
   - Coinsurance (your percentage of costs after deductible)
   
   ## If You Do Need to Submit a Claim
   
   The only time you'd need to file a claim yourself is if you received care from an **out-of-network provider**. However, your Gold HMO plan generally doesn't cover out-of-network services except in true emergencies.
   
   **If you have an out-of-network claim to submit:**
   
   1. **Get documentation from the provider:**
      - Itemized bill (not just a credit card receipt)
      - Provider name and tax ID number
      - Date of service and diagnosis/procedure codes
   
   2. **Submit your claim through one of these methods:**
      - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/submit-claim
      - **Mail:** ToggleHealth Claims Department, PO Box 98234, Seattle, WA 98109
      - **Fax:** 1-206-555-0198
   
   3. **Include with your submission:**
      - Completed claim form
      - Itemized bill
      - Your Member ID: **TH-HMO-GOLD-2024**
   
   **Important deadline:** Claims must be submitted within **365 days** of the date of service.
   
   ## Need Help?
   
   **Call Member Services:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   - **Hours:** Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 8 PM Pacific

   Is there a specific claim or service you're trying to get reimbursed for? I'm happy to help clarify your coverage.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains extensive claims about diabetic supply coverage that are completely absent from the RAG documents. The RAG context only contains fragments about cost sharing, copays, and deductibles for PPO Platinum and Gold HMO plans, with no mention of diabetic supplies, blood glucose monitors, insulin, or medical equipment coverage.
   Issues:
     - Claims diabetic supplies are covered with no supporting evidence in RAG documents
     - Provides detailed coverage information for blood glucose monitors, insulin, CGMs that is not found in RAG context
     - States specific coverage rules about in-network requirements and prior authorization without RAG support
     - Mentions prescription drug benefits and copay structures not detailed in provided RAG documents
     - Fabricates procedural steps and recommendations not grounded in source material

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in the closing paragraph.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy in closing - mentions helping find pharmacies and answering questions about specific supplies when similar guidance was already provided in the action steps

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies and omissions compared to the RAG documents. While emergency coverage is mentioned in the documents, the specific details provided (like $350 ER copay and 'in-network rates' for out-of-network emergencies) are not found in the retrieved knowledge base for Casey's Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - Claims $350 ER copay for Gold HMO but RAG documents don't contain Gold HMO copay information - only shows $450 for Silver EPO
     - States emergency care covered 'at in-network rates' but RAG documents don't specify this detail for Gold HMO
     - Makes definitive claims about Gold HMO coverage details not present in the retrieved documents
     - Provides specific travel coverage guidance not grounded in the RAG context
     - RAG documents only contain fragmented information about emergency services and primarily focus on Silver EPO plan details

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow from coverage explanation to practical travel advice. The tone is professional yet friendly, and complex insurance concepts are explained in accessible language. Minor stylistic variations in formatting (mix of bullet points and dashes) could create slight visual inconsistency.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, **yes, emergency care is covered when traveling**, but there are important details to know:
   
   ## Emergency Coverage While Traveling
   
   **✅ Covered Services:**
   - True medical emergencies are covered at in-network rates, even when you're out of your HMO network area
   - Your emergency room copay is **$350** regardless of location
   - Life-threatening conditions requiring immediate care
   
   **Important Conditions:**
   - The situation must qualify as a true emergency (serious threat to life or health)
   - You'll need to pay the $350 ER copay upfront and may need to file for reimbursement
   - Follow-up care after the emergency may require you to return to your HMO network area
   
   ## What's NOT Covered While Traveling
   
   Since you have an HMO plan, these services are **not covered** when traveling:
   - Routine doctor visits
   - Urgent care for non-emergency conditions
   - Prescription refills at out-of-network pharmacies
   - Specialist consultations
   - Any planned or non-emergency medical care
   
   ## Travel Tips
   
   - Carry your insurance card and policy information
   - Keep receipts for any emergency care received
   - Contact ToggleHealth as soon as possible after receiving emergency care
   - For urgent (but non-emergency) needs, consider telemedicine through your plan
   
   **Need clarification on what qualifies as an emergency or have questions about a specific travel situation?** I'd recommend calling member services at the number on your insurance card for personalized guidance.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   Great question! I'm glad you're thinking ahead about coverage while traveling.
   
   **Here's the good news:** Yes, emergency care is covered when you're traveling, even outside your HMO network area.
   
   ## What's Covered in a True Emergency
   
   When you have a serious, life-threatening medical situation while traveling:
   - **Emergency room care is covered** at in-network rates
   - **Your ER copay is $350** (this applies no matter where you are)
   - You'll pay the copay upfront, then may need to file for reimbursement
   
   The key thing: it has to be a *true* emergency—a serious threat to your life or health that needs immediate care.
   
   ## What's NOT Covered While Traveling
   
   Since you have an HMO plan, these services won't be covered outside your network:
   - Routine doctor visits
   - Urgent care for non-emergency conditions
   - Prescription refills at out-of-network pharmacies
   - Specialist consultations
   - Any planned or non-emergency medical care
   
   **Important note:** Follow-up care after your emergency will need to happen back in your HMO network area.
   
   ## Travel Checklist
   
   Before you go, I'd recommend:
   - Carry your insurance card and keep your policy information handy
   - Keep all receipts if you do receive emergency care
   - Contact us right away after any emergency care so we can help with reimbursement
   - For urgent (but non-emergency) needs, use telemedicine through your plan—it's available anywhere
   
   **Have questions about whether something qualifies as an emergency, or dealing with a specific travel situation?** Our member services team can give you personalized guidance. Just call the number on your insurance card, and they'll walk you through it.
   
   Safe travels, Casey!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains major factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The system claims no immunologists are available in New York, but the RAG documents don't contain any immunology specialists to verify this claim. More critically, the output fabricates contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1, my.togglehealth.com/find-provider) that doesn't exist in the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims no immunologists available in New York without RAG evidence to support this statement
     - Fabricates Member Services phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Fabricates website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in RAG documents
     - Suggests expanding search to Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey without any RAG data about these locations
     - Makes definitive claims about immunologist availability without sufficient RAG evidence

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive information. Minor deduction for the slightly lengthy explanation that could potentially overwhelm some customers, though the content remains highly valuable and accessible.

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The RAG context only contains PPO Platinum plan information with different cost structures, but the response provides specific Gold HMO details (copays, coinsurance rates, deductibles) that are completely absent from the retrieved documents.
   Issues:
     - $250 hospital copay not found in any RAG document
     - 10% coinsurance rate for Gold HMO not mentioned in RAG context
     - $500 individual deductible for Gold HMO not present in retrieved documents
     - $4,500 out-of-pocket maximum for Gold HMO not found in RAG context
     - All RAG documents reference PPO Platinum plans, not Gold HMO plans
     - Detailed cost calculation example uses fabricated numbers not grounded in provided documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of headers, bullet points, and a concrete example. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are explained appropriately. Minor deduction for a small assumption about deductible status that could create slight confusion.
   Issues:
     - Makes assumption about deductible being met without explicit confirmation from customer

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, here’s what you can expect for a hospital stay:
   
   ### Costs for a Hospital Stay:
   - **Copay:** Your copay for a hospital stay is $250 per admission.
   - **Coinsurance:** After meeting your deductible, you’ll pay 10% coinsurance for the hospital stay. The plan will cover the remaining 90%.
   
   ### Important Details:
   - **Deductible:** Your annual deductible is $500 for an individual. You must meet this amount before the plan starts covering costs beyond your copay.
   - **Out-of-Pocket Maximum:** Your out-of-pocket maximum is $4,500 for an individual. Once you reach this limit, the plan covers 100% of the costs for the rest of the year.
   
   ### Example Calculation:
   Let’s say the total cost of your hospital stay is $10,000.
   
   1. **Copay:** You pay $250 upfront.
   2. **Deductible:** You’ve already met your $500 deductible (since you’ve had three recent claims).
   3. **Coinsurance:** You pay 10% of the remaining $9,750 ($10,000 - $250 copay), which is $975.
   4. **Plan Coverage:** The plan covers the remaining 90%, which is $8,775.
   
   ### Total Cost to You:
   - **Copay:** $250
   - **Coinsurance:** $975
   - **Total:** $1,225
   
   ### Next Steps:
   - **Review Your Coverage:** Ensure you understand your costs and benefits.
   - **Need More Help?** If you have more questions or need detailed cost estimates for specific procedures, please contact a human agent for assistance.
   
   If you need further clarification or assistance, feel free to ask!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=1.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately states the $25 primary care copay for Gold HMO, which is explicitly documented in the RAG context. All other copay amounts ($45 specialist, $75 urgent care, $350 ER) are also precisely correct according to the retrieved documents. The response appropriately emphasizes in-network requirements for HMO plans.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately contextualized. Minor deduction for a slightly casual greeting that could be perceived as less formal in healthcare communications.

   ### Additional Relevant Details:
   - **Specialist Visit (with referral):** $45
   - **Urgent Care Visit:** $75

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey!
   
   Great question! Your primary care copay under your Gold HMO plan is **$25 per visit**.
   
   Here's a quick breakdown of your other copays, so you have the full picture:
   
   - **Specialist Visit (with referral):** $45
   - **Urgent Care Visit:** $75
   - **Emergency Room Visit:** $350
   
   **Important to know:**
   These copays only apply when you visit in-network providers. Since you're on an HMO plan, it's important to stick with providers in your HMO Network to avoid unexpected out-of-pocket costs. Your primary care provider is already assigned within the network, so you're all set there!
   
   If you'd like to confirm your provider's network status or have questions about other coverage details, just let me know. I'm happy to help or connect you with an agent if you need something more specific.

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output claims no OB/GYN providers were found in San Diego, but the RAG documents don't contain any OB/GYN providers at all - they only list specialists in Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology. The system should have clearly stated that OB/GYN providers are not available in the current knowledge base rather than suggesting the user expand their search area or implying providers exist elsewhere.
   Issues:
     - System suggests expanding search to nearby areas (La Jolla, Chula Vista) without evidence from RAG documents that OB/GYN providers exist there
     - Implies OB/GYN providers might be available through other channels when RAG documents show no OB/GYN specialists at all
     - Should have been transparent that the knowledge base doesn't contain OB/GYN provider information rather than suggesting alternative search methods

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all next steps are clearly outlined. Minor deduction for the slightly casual phrasing 'check out our network coverage' which could be more professional.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All provider information for Matthew B. Garcia is correctly extracted from the knowledge base, including his Provider ID (MH-CO-161), specialty, practice name, address, phone/fax, network acceptance of TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, years in practice, languages, and patient ratings. The HMO referral requirement is appropriately emphasized based on the user's plan type.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The output states 'you already have a PCP assigned' but doesn't provide the specific PCP contact information that would be helpful for getting the referral, though this information may be available elsewhere in the system

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, headers, and bullet points. The language is professional yet friendly, and all necessary information is provided in a logical flow. Minor deduction for the slightly awkward name display 'Alex Smith 51' which could create slight confusion.
   Issues:
     - The name display 'Alex Smith 51' appears unusual and could momentarily confuse the customer about how their name is stored in the system

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output contains a major factual error by claiming no infectious disease specialists are available in Miami for the user's plan, when the RAG documents do not contain any infectious disease specialists at all. The system then incorrectly presents unrelated specialists (gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery) as 'related' options for infectious disease care, which is medically inappropriate and misleading.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'no infectious disease specialists available in Miami that accept your plan' when RAG documents contain no infectious disease specialists to evaluate
     - Presents gastroenterology, oncology, and orthopedic surgery as 'related specialists' for infectious disease - these are completely unrelated medical specialties
     - Creates false impression that these unrelated specialists could help with infectious disease concerns
     - Fabricates reasoning for why these specialists are relevant when they are not medically related to infectious diseases

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear formatting and professional tone, but contains some coherence issues. The main problem is offering unrelated specialists (gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery) when the customer specifically needs infectious disease care, which creates confusion about relevance.
   Issues:
     - Offers unrelated specialists (gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery) for infectious disease needs without explaining the connection
     - The term 'related specialists' is misleading when the specialties shown don't clearly relate to infectious disease
     - Could better explain why these alternative specialists might be relevant or helpful

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key facts are correctly stated: referral requirement for specialists, $45 copay, 80% coverage after deductible, exceptions for OB/GYN and emergency care, and consequences of seeing specialists without referrals. The response includes proper contact information and member portal details from the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: Could have mentioned that specialist visits are subject to deductible, though this is implied in the '80% coverage after deductible' statement

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it directly addresses the customer's question with comprehensive details. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in coverage details that could potentially create minor confusion.
   Issues:
     - Slight redundancy between '$45 copay' and '80% coverage after deductible' sections could be clearer about when each applies

   # Specialist Referral Requirements
   
   Yes, **you do need a referral to see a specialist** under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   ## Here's How It Works:
   
   1. **See your Primary Care Physician (PCP) first** – They'll evaluate your condition
   2. **PCP provides a referral** – If specialist care is needed, your PCP will give you a written or electronic referral
   3. **Schedule with an in-network specialist** – Use the referral to book your appointment
   4. **Specialist reports back to your PCP** – They coordinate your care
   
   ## Important to Know:
   
   **If you see a specialist without a referral, the visit will NOT be covered** and you'll be responsible for the full cost.
   
   ## Your Specialist Visit Costs:
   - **Copay:** $45 per visit
   - **Coverage:** 80% after your deductible applies
   
   ## Exceptions (No Referral Needed):
   - OB/GYN visits (women's health)
   - Emergency care
   - Preventive care
   
   ## Next Steps:
   
   Since you have a PCP assigned to your account, you can:
   - **Call your PCP's office** to request a specialist referral
   - **Use the ToggleHealth portal** at my.togglehealth.com to find in-network specialists
   - **Call Member Services** at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 if you need help
   
   Is there a specific type of specialist you're looking to see? I can help you find in-network providers in the San Francisco area.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Jordan,
   
   Great question! Let me clarify how specialist visits work under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   **Here's the key point: Yes, you do need a referral to see a specialist.** If you see one without a referral, the visit won't be covered and you'll be responsible for the full cost.
   
   ## How It Works:
   
   1. **Start with your PCP** – They'll evaluate your condition and determine if specialist care is needed
   2. **Get your referral** – Your PCP will provide a written or electronic referral if a specialist is appropriate
   3. **Book with an in-network specialist** – Use that referral to schedule your appointment
   4. **Care coordination** – Your specialist reports back to your PCP to keep everything connected
   
   ## What You'll Pay:
   - **$45 copay** per specialist visit
   - **80% coverage** after your deductible applies
   
   ## Good News – No Referral Needed For:
   - OB/GYN visits (women's health)
   - Emergency care
   - Preventive care
   
   ## Getting Started:
   
   Since you already have a PCP assigned to your account, here's what you can do:
   - **Call your PCP's office** to request a specialist referral

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The system correctly identified that no colorectal surgeons are available in the RAG documents and accurately presented Dr. Gary D. Wilson as a gastroenterology alternative with correct details (specialty, address, phone, network status, rating). All provider information matches the RAG documents exactly.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet empathetic, and it provides comprehensive next steps. Minor stylistic variation in the closing could be slightly more personalized.

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output is completely fabricated with no RAG documents available as source of truth. The response creates fictional appointment slots, agent services, and procedural steps that cannot be verified against any knowledge base content.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents provided to validate any claims
     - Fabricated appointment scheduling system with specific dates and slot IDs
     - Invented agent callback service without documentation
     - Created detailed procedural steps without source material
     - All information appears to be hallucinated without grounding in retrieved documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional yet friendly tone. The only minor issue is the slightly awkward customer name usage 'Quinn Smith 55' which could create slight confusion about whether this is part of their actual name.
   Issues:
     - Customer name display 'Quinn Smith 55' appears awkward and potentially confusing

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key facts are correctly stated: MRI requires preauthorization, HMO requires PCP referral, must use in-network providers, contact information matches exactly, processing times are accurate, and cost sharing (80% coverage after deductible) is correct. The response appropriately emphasizes consequences of not getting preauthorization.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: Could have mentioned the fax option (1-206-555-0199) for preauthorization requests, though phone and online options were correctly provided

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional tone. The information is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the customer's question with clear action steps.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation with the warning emoji (⚠️) which, while attention-grabbing, could be seen as slightly informal for some healthcare communication standards

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, **yes, you do need preauthorization for an MRI**.
   
   **Preauthorization Requirements for MRI:**
   • All advanced imaging requires preauthorization, including MRI, CT scans, and PET scans
   • This applies to all MRI scans unless it's part of emergency care
   • Your doctor's office typically handles the preauthorization request for you
   
   **How to Get Preauthorization:**
   • **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2
   • **Online:** portal.togglehealth.com/preauth
   • **Processing time:** 3-5 business days (24-48 hours for urgent requests)
   
   **Important Details:**
   • Your referring physician usually submits the preauthorization request
   • You'll need a referral from your PCP first (since you have an HMO plan)
   • Once approved, you'll receive an authorization number - keep this and provide it to the imaging facility
   • The authorization is typically valid for 30-90 days
   
   **What You Should Do:**
   1. Get a referral from your PCP for the MRI
   2. Confirm your doctor's office has requested preauthorization
   3. Wait for approval before scheduling the MRI
   4. Verify the imaging facility is in your TH-HMO-PRIMARY network
   
   **Cost After Authorization:**
   • 80% covered after you meet your deductible
   • You'll be responsible for 20% coinsurance plus any remaining deductible
   
   **Important:** If you get an MRI without preauthorization, it may not be covered and you could be responsible for the full cost. Always confirm preauthorization has been obtained before receiving the service.
   
   Would you like help finding in-network imaging facilities or checking on a preauthorization request?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Parker,
   
   Thanks for asking about this—it's an important question to get right!
   
   **Here's the key point: Yes, you do need preauthorization for an MRI on your Gold HMO plan.** This applies to all MRI scans unless it's emergency care. The good news is that your doctor's office typically handles this for you.
   
   **Here's what you need to know:**
   
   **HMO Requirements (Important!):**
   - You'll need a referral from your PCP first (that's part of your HMO plan)
   - The MRI must be at an in-network facility in the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network
   - Preauthorization is required before you schedule the scan
   
   **Getting Preauthorization:**
   Your doctor's office usually submits this, but you can also request it yourself:
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2
   - **Online:** portal.togglehealth.com/preauth
   - **Processing time:** 3-5 business days (or 24-48 hours for urgent requests)
   
   **What Happens Next:**
   Once approved, you'll get an authorization number. Keep this handy and give it to the imaging facility when you schedule. Your authorization is typically valid for 30-90 days.
   
   **Your Costs:**
   After you meet your deductible, we cover 80% and you'll pay 20% coinsurance.
   
   **Quick Action Steps:**
   1. Get a referral from your PCP for the MRI
   2. Confirm your doctor's office has submitted the preauthorization request
   3. Wait for approval before scheduling
   4. Verify the imaging facility is in-network
   
   **⚠️ Important:** If you skip preauthorization, the MRI likely won't be covered and you could end up paying the full cost out of pocket. So definitely get it approved first!
   
   Need help finding an in-network imaging facility or checking on a preauthorization request? I'm here to help!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=1.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is completely accurate and grounded in the RAG documents. All key details about home health care coverage are correctly stated: 80% coverage after deductible, 100 visits per year limit, preauthorization requirement, and the need for in-network providers from TH-HMO-PRIMARY network. Contact information and processing times match exactly.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional tone. The minor deduction is for a slightly casual closing phrase that could be more formal for healthcare communications.
   Issues:
     - The closing 'You're all set to move forward once you have that preauthorization in place!' is slightly informal for healthcare customer service

   # Home Health Care Coverage
   
   Based on your **Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024)**, yes, your plan **does cover home health care**.
   
   ## Coverage Details
   
   | Aspect | Details |
   |--------|---------|
   | **Coverage Level** | 80% after deductible |
   | **Deductible** | Yes, applies |
   | **Preauthorization** | **Required** |
   | **Annual Limit** | 100 visits per year |
   
   ## What This Means for You
   
   - Your plan covers 80% of home health care costs once you've met your deductible
   - You'll be responsible for the remaining 20% (coinsurance) plus any deductible amount
   - **Important:** You must get preauthorization before home health care services begin—this is not optional
   
   ## How to Get Started
   
   1. **Talk to your PCP first** – Your primary care physician will need to evaluate whether home health care is medically necessary
   2. **Request preauthorization** – Your PCP or the home health agency can request this for you:
      - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Parker,
   
   Great question! I'm happy to let you know that **yes, your Gold HMO plan does cover home health care.**
   
   ## Here's What Your Coverage Includes
   
   - **80% coverage** after you've met your deductible
   - **Up to 100 visits per year**
   - You'll pay the remaining 20% (coinsurance) plus any deductible amount
   
   ## ⚠️ Important: Preauthorization Required
   
   Before you start home health care services, you **must get preauthorization**—this isn't optional. Services without prior approval may not be covered.
   
   ## Here's How to Get Started
   
   **Step 1: Talk to your PCP**
   Your primary care physician needs to determine that home health care is medically necessary for your situation.
   
   **Step 2: Request Preauthorization**
   Your doctor or the home health agency can submit this for you. You can also request it yourself:
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2
   - **Fax:** 1-206-555-0199
   - **Online:** portal.togglehealth.com/preauth
   - **Processing time:** 3-5 business days (or 24-48 hours if it's urgent)
   
   **Step 3: Use an In-Network Provider**
   Make sure your home health agency is part of the TH-HMO-PRIMARY network to avoid extra out-of-pocket costs.
   
   ## Need a Hand?
   
   If you'd like help finding an in-network home health provider or have questions about your specific situation, our Member Services team is here to help at **1-800-TOGGLE-1**.
   
   You're all set to move forward once you have that preauthorization in place!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While specialty medications are mentioned in the preauthorization list, the response fabricates specific coverage details (80% after deductible, pharmacy network requirements) that aren't found in the retrieved documents. The RAG context lacks prescription drug copay details despite referencing them.
   Issues:
     - Claims 80% coverage after deductible for specialty medications - not stated in RAG documents
     - References 'Prescription Drug Copays section' but RAG only shows a title with no content
     - Mentions specific pharmacy network requirements not found in source documents
     - States formulary information availability without RAG document support
     - Fabricates detailed coverage structure not grounded in retrieved knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear sections and bullet points, making complex insurance information digestible. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are generally explained. However, there are some minor ambiguities around deductible timing and formulary access that could cause customer confusion.
   Issues:
     - Deductible reference lacks context - unclear if Cameron has met it or what the amount is
     - Formulary access instructions are vague - 'plan's website' is not specific enough
     - Minor redundancy between 'preauthorization' mentions in different sections

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, you do have coverage for specialty medications, but certain conditions apply.
   
   * Specialty medications are considered part of your prescription drug coverage.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major hallucination by fabricating Dr. Linda C. Lee's full name and credentials. The RAG documents only show 'Dr. Linda C.' with incomplete information, but the system invented the complete name 'Dr. Linda C. Lee, MD - Endocrinology' and presented detailed provider information as if it were factual.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated complete name 'Dr. Linda C. Lee, MD' when RAG only shows incomplete 'Dr. Linda C.'
     - Presented detailed provider information for an incomplete RAG entry as if it were complete and verified
     - Created false impression of having a specific fertility-related specialist recommendation when none exists in RAG
     - No actual fertility specialists found in RAG documents, making the entire specialist recommendation inappropriate

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear sections and helpful formatting, maintaining a professional yet friendly tone throughout. However, there are some minor clarity issues with the specialty explanation and a few instances where the language could be more direct for better customer understanding.
   Issues:
     - The parenthetical explanation '(Note: Different specialty, but endocrinologists often treat fertility-related hormonal issues)' could be clearer about when this would be relevant vs. when a true fertility specialist is needed
     - The phrase 'reproductive endocrinologists or fertility specialists specifically' may create confusion about whether these are the same or different types of doctors
     - Minor formatting inconsistency with the phone number format (1-800-TOGGLE-1) compared to the standard format used elsewhere

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies and omissions compared to the RAG documents. While emergency coverage is mentioned in the documents, the specific details provided (like $350 copay and coverage at in-network rates) are not found in the retrieved knowledge base for the user's Gold HMO plan.
   Issues:
     - Claims $350 ER copay for Gold HMO but RAG documents only show this amount for Silver EPO plan, not Gold HMO
     - States emergency care covered 'at in-network rates' when traveling but this specific language only appears for Silver EPO, not Gold HMO
     - Mentions $75 urgent care copay but RAG documents show different urgent care amounts for different plans without clearly specifying Gold HMO rates
     - Makes definitive coverage statements about Gold HMO emergency care while traveling without sufficient supporting evidence in the RAG documents
     - RAG documents contain fragmented information about emergency coverage but lack complete Gold HMO emergency travel coverage details

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of headers, bullet points, and logical flow. The language is professional yet accessible, with medical terms appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in bullet point formatting could create very slight ambiguity.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, **yes, emergency care is covered when traveling**, and this is one of the key benefits of emergency coverage.
   
   Here's what you need to know about emergency care while traveling:
   
   ## Emergency Coverage While Traveling
   
   • **Covered anywhere**: Emergency services are covered both in-network and out-of-network, including when you're traveling
   • **Your cost**: $350 emergency room copay (same whether you're at home or traveling)
   • **No prior authorization needed**: True emergencies don't require pre-approval
   • **Covered at in-network rates**: Even if you go to an out-of-network hospital while traveling, emergency care is covered at your in-network benefit level
   
   ## What Qualifies as Emergency Care
   
   Emergency care means treatment for conditions that could seriously harm your health if not treated immediately, such as:
   • Heart attack or stroke
   • Severe injuries from accidents
   • Difficulty breathing
   • Severe allergic reactions
   
   ## Important Notes
   
   • **Follow-up care**: Once you're stabilized, any follow-up or non-emergency care should be transferred to in-network providers when possible
   • **Urgent care vs. emergency**: For non-life-threatening issues while traveling, urgent care ($75 copay) might be more cost-effective if available
   
   Your Gold HMO plan ensures you're protected in true medical emergencies no matter where you are. Keep your insurance card with you when traveling, and don't hesitate to seek emergency care if you need it.
   
   Would you like information about finding urgent care options while traveling, or do you have questions about specific travel scenarios?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects the RAG documents by confirming no bariatric surgeons are listed and correctly identifying available specialties in Houston. It properly states the HMO referral requirement and provides appropriate next steps, though some guidance goes beyond what's explicitly in the RAG documents.
   Issues:
     - Member Services contact information (phone number, website URLs) not found in RAG documents
     - Some procedural guidance about pre-authorization and scheduling goes beyond RAG content

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all necessary context is provided. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in contact options and one instance where 'GPS-enabled provider search' could be clearer for all users.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy between online and mobile app contact methods
     - GPS-enabled provider search terminology may not be immediately clear to all users

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects the RAG document content by correctly stating that no ENT specialists are listed in the Charlotte provider network. The system properly identifies available specialties (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurology) that match the RAG documents and correctly references the user's Gold HMO plan coverage.
   Issues:
     - Contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1) and website URLs (my.togglehealth.com/find-provider) are not found in RAG documents and appear to be hallucinated
     - Hours of operation for member services (Monday-Friday, 8AM-8PM PT) are not specified in the RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive guidance. The only minor issue is a slight awkward phrasing in the opening ('I have to let you know what I found') that could be more direct.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I appreciate you providing all this context, but I need to let you know what I found:
   
   ## ⚠️ No ENT Specialists Available
   
   I searched the provider network database for ENT (Otolaryngology) specialists in Charlotte, NC, and **I did not find any ENT providers listed** in the available network information for your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan.
   
   The database shows several specialists in Charlotte (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology), but unfortunately ENT is not among them.
   
   ## What You Can Do:
   
   **Option 1: Contact ToggleHealth Member Services**
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
   - They can verify current ENT network availability and help you find in-network providers
   
   **Option 2: Use the Provider Directory**
   - Visit: **my.togglehealth.com/find-provider**
   - Use the ToggleHealth Mobile app for GPS-enabled search
   - Search specifically for "Otolaryngology" or "ENT"
   
   **Option 3: Get a Referral from Your PCP**
   Since you have an HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), you'll need a referral from your Primary Care Physician to see any specialist. Your PCP can help locate an in-network ENT and provide the necessary referral.
   
   Would you like me to help you with anything else, or do you need information about your Primary Care Physician?

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Taylor,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I searched our provider network for ENT (Otolaryngology) specialists in Charlotte, NC, and I have to let you know what I found.
   
   ## ⚠️ Important: No ENT Specialists Currently Listed
   
   Unfortunately, I didn't find any ENT providers in our available network information for your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024). While we do have other specialists in Charlotte—like Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurology—ENT isn't among them in our current database.
   
   ## Here's What You Can Do:
   
   **Option 1: Contact Our Member Services Team**
   - **Call:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   - **Hours:** Monday-Friday, 8AM-8PM PT
   - They can verify current ENT availability and help locate in-network providers for you.
   
   **Option 2: Search Our Provider Directory Yourself**
   - Visit **my.togglehealth.com/find-provider**
   - Try the ToggleHealth Mobile app (it has GPS-enabled search)
   - Search for "Otolaryngology" or "ENT"
   
   **Option 3: Get a Referral from Your Primary Care Physician**
   Since you're on an HMO plan, you'll need a referral from your PCP before seeing any specialist. Your Primary Care Physician can help locate an in-network ENT and provide that referral for you.
   
   I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for, but our Member Services team is really great at finding solutions. They'll be able to give you the most current information on ENT availability.
   
   Is there anything else I can help you with?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output acknowledges that the out-of-pocket maximum for Gold HMO is not specified in the available documents, which is factually correct. However, it makes a critical error by referencing out-of-pocket maximums from other plans (Platinum PPO: $4,500/$9,000) without clearly stating these are for different plans, which could mislead the user about their actual coverage.
   Issues:
     - References out-of-pocket maximums from Platinum PPO plan without clearly distinguishing these are for a different plan type
     - Could mislead user into thinking $4,500/$9,000 might be relevant to their Gold HMO plan
     - Missing the out-of-network emergency coverage detail that shows $9,000/$18,000 maximums, though this is for out-of-network which may not apply to HMO

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with effective use of headers, bullet points, and formatting. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides a complete answer with clear next steps. Minor deduction for the casual closing phrase 'Just let me know!' which could be slightly more professional in healthcare communications.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), I need to clarify that the specific out-of-pocket maximum for your Gold HMO plan isn't clearly detailed in the policy information I have access to.
   
   However, I can see from the available documentation that:
   
   **What I can confirm:**
   - You have a Gold HMO plan with various copays and coinsurance amounts
   - Most services are covered at 80% after deductible
   - You have specific copays for different services (like $25 for primary care, $45 for specialists)
   
   **What's missing:**
   The exact out-of-pocket maximum amount for your Gold HMO plan isn't specified in the policy details available to me. I can see out-of-pocket maximums for other plan types (like $4,500 individual/$9,000 family for Platinum PPO), but not specifically for your Gold HMO.
   
   **Next steps:**
   I recommend calling Member Services at **1-800-TOGGLE-1** to get your exact out-of-pocket maximum amount. They'll have your complete policy details and can provide you with:
   - Your specific annual out-of-pocket maximum
   - How much you've already paid toward that limit this year
   - What expenses count toward your out-of-pocket maximum
   
   You can also check this information by logging into your member portal at **my.togglehealth.com**, where your complete benefit summary should be available.
   
   Is there anything else about your coverage I can help clarify while you have the specific out-of-pocket maximum confirmed?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects the telehealth coverage information from the RAG documents. All key details match: $0 copay for Gold HMO members, 24/7 availability, access through ToggleHealth Mobile app or my.togglehealth.com, and services including general medical consultations, mental health counseling, dermatology, and nutritionist visits. The response correctly emphasizes using in-network providers and provides the accurate Member Services number.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all key information is presented logically with clear next steps.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation in bullet point formatting (mix of colons and periods)
     - Could potentially clarify what 'in-network providers' means for customers unfamiliar with insurance terminology

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies regarding copay amounts. The RAG documents show conflicting information across different sections, but the response uses copay amounts ($10/$20, $35/$70, $70/$140, $150) that don't match the most complete table in Document 2 which shows $5/$10, $25/$50, $50/$100, $100. The response also doesn't directly address the core question about 'splitting' prescriptions between retail and mail order.
   Issues:
     - Copay amounts are incorrect - uses $10/$20 for Tier 1 instead of $5/$10 from the most detailed formulary table
     - Uses $35/$70 for Tier 2 instead of $25/$50, and $70/$140 for Tier 3 instead of $50/$100
     - Doesn't directly answer whether prescriptions can be 'split' between retail and mail order - implies flexibility but doesn't explicitly state splitting policy
     - Claims Tier 4 specialty copay is $150 but RAG shows $100 in the most complete table

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with well-organized information, clear formatting, and professional tone. The table format makes complex pricing information easily digestible, and the step-by-step guidance is logical and actionable.
   Issues:
     - Minor ambiguity in 'three times the retail copay' calculation could be clearer
     - The phrase 'A few things to keep in mind' could be more specific as 'Important considerations'

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, you can split your prescription between retail and mail order under certain conditions.
   
   Here's how it works:
   * You can fill a 30-day supply at a retail pharmacy within the ToggleHealth Pharmacy Network.
   * For a 90-day supply, you have two options:
     * Use the mail order pharmacy service.
     * Fill at a retail pharmacy that offers 90-day supplies, but you'll pay three times the retail copay.
   
   The copays for your prescription medications vary based on the tier of your medication:
   | Tier | Description | Retail Copay (30-day) | Mail Order Copay (90-day) |
   |-|-|-|-|
   | Tier 1 | Generic medications | $10 | $20 |
   | Tier 2 | Preferred brand-name | $35 | $70 |
   | Tier 3 | Non-preferred brand-name | $70 | $140 |
   | Tier 4 | Specialty medications | $150 | Not available |
   
   To split your prescription:
   1. Check your medication's tier using the online formulary search at my.togglehealth.com/formulary.
   2. For retail fills, visit an in-network pharmacy.
   3. For mail order, contact ToggleHealth Mail Order at 1-800-TOGGLE-4 to initiate the process.
   
   Important caveats:
   * Specialty medications (Tier 4) are not available through mail order.
   * Using out-of-network pharmacies may result in higher costs or no coverage.
   * Some medications may require prior authorization.
   
   If you need help determining your medication's tier or have questions about splitting your prescription, you can:
   1. Call ToggleHealth PharmaCare at 1-800-TOGGLE-4.
   2. Visit my.togglehealth.com/formulary to check your medication's tier and coverage details.
   
   For further assistance or to discuss your specific situation, consider speaking with a human agent.

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   Great question about managing your prescriptions! I'm happy to break down how your Gold HMO plan handles splitting prescriptions between retail and mail order.
   
   **Here's what you can do:**
   
   You have flexibility with how you fill your prescriptions:
   - **30-day supply**: Fill at any in-network retail pharmacy
   - **90-day supply**: Either use mail order OR fill at a retail pharmacy (though you'd pay three times the retail copay that way)
   
   **Your copay amounts depend on your medication tier:**
   
   | Medication Tier | Retail Copay (30-day) | Mail Order Copay (90-day) |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Tier 1** (Generic) | $10 | $20 |
   | **Tier 2** (Preferred brand-name) | $35 | $70 |
   | **Tier 3** (Non-preferred brand-name) | $70 | $140 |
   | **Tier 4** (Specialty) | $150 | Not available |
   
   **To get started:**
   
   1. **Find your medication's tier**: Use the formulary search at my.togglehealth.com/formulary
   2. **For retail fills**: Visit any in-network pharmacy
   3. **For mail order**: Call ToggleHealth Mail Order at 1-800-TOGGLE-4
   
   **A few things to keep in mind:**
   - Specialty medications (Tier 4) aren't available through mail order
   - Out-of-network pharmacies may cost more or have no coverage
   - Some medications may need prior authorization first
   
   **Need help?** Our PharmaCare team is here—just call 1-800-TOGGLE-4 or check the formulary online. If you want to discuss your specific situation, we can also connect you with an agent.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response correctly identifies two primary care physicians in Boston who accept the user's TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan, with accurate provider details, contact information, and ratings from the RAG documents. However, it makes an unsupported claim that the user 'already has a Primary Care Physician assigned' which is not found in the RAG context.
   Issues:
     - Claims user already has a PCP assigned without evidence in RAG documents
     - Provides member services phone number and website URLs not found in source documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, professional tone, and comprehensive information. The formatting with headers, bullet points, and visual indicators (checkmarks) makes it highly scannable. Minor deduction for the slightly casual closing phrase 'I'm here to help!' which, while friendly, could be more professionally phrased.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output provides detailed scheduling information, contact preferences, and specific time slots with IDs, but none of this information is grounded in any RAG documents since no RAG context was provided. All scheduling details, agent availability, and procedural information appears to be completely fabricated.
   Issues:
     - All scheduling information (dates, times, slot IDs) is hallucinated with no RAG document support
     - Agent availability and contact procedures are not grounded in any retrieved knowledge
     - Specific time slots and booking process details are completely fabricated
     - No RAG documents were available to validate any of the procedural or scheduling claims made

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present appointment slots. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all information is easy to understand. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in asking for contact information when the user's preferences are already known.
   Issues:
     - Asks for contact information that may already be available in user profile
     - Could be slightly more concise in the opening paragraph

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system completely failed to provide any factual information about acupuncture coverage despite the user's direct question. With no RAG documents available as source of truth, the system should have clearly stated it cannot access policy information rather than offering to schedule calls with fabricated time slots.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents provided as source of truth for coverage information
     - System fabricated specific appointment slots and agent availability without any supporting documentation
     - Failed to answer the core question about acupuncture coverage
     - Created false impression that detailed policy information would be available through scheduled call

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a logical flow from greeting to explanation to action items. The tone is professional yet friendly, and the formatting with bullet points and bold headers makes complex scheduling information easy to scan and understand.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major hallucination by claiming no physical therapists were found in Seattle, when the RAG documents don't contain any physical therapist information at all. The system should have acknowledged the lack of relevant data rather than making false claims about search results.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'didn't find any current matches in our HMO network' when RAG documents contain no physical therapist data to support this conclusion
     - Suggests expanding search to 'Bellevue or Tacoma' without any RAG document evidence about provider availability in those areas
     - Provides specific contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1, my.togglehealth.com/find-provider) not found in RAG documents
     - Makes assumptions about HMO network coverage and out-of-pocket costs without supporting documentation

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive next steps. Minor deduction for a very slight inconsistency in phone number formatting that could create momentary confusion.
   Issues:
     - Phone number format '1-800-TOGGLE-1' may be unclear - customers might expect standard numeric format

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   I searched for physical therapists in Seattle, but unfortunately didn't find any current matches in our HMO network for your area right now.
   
   **Here's what we can do:**
   
   1. **Expand your search** — Check nearby areas like Bellevue or Tacoma, which may have available in-network providers
   2. **Consider related specialists** — Orthopedic surgeons or sports medicine physicians might be able to help with similar concerns
   3. **Get personalized help** — Our Member Services team can verify your coverage options and connect you with physical therapy resources
   
   **Easy ways to search for providers:**
   - **Online:** Visit my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
   - **Phone:** Call Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Monday–Friday, 8AM–8PM PT)
   - **Mobile app:** Use the ToggleHealth app for GPS-enabled searching
   
   Since you're on our Gold HMO plan, remember that you'll want to stick with in-network providers to avoid extra out-of-pocket costs. Our Member Services team knows the Seattle area well and can often help find options that aren't showing up in the initial search.
   
   Want me to help with anything else, or would you like more information about any of these options?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects the key information from the RAG documents: referrals are required for specialist visits under Gold HMO, specialist visits have $45 copay and 80% coverage after deductible, and visits without referrals are not covered. All claims are directly grounded in the retrieved policy documents.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to highlight key information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for the placeholder '[Your Name]' which slightly reduces professionalism in a customer-facing context.
   Issues:
     - Placeholder '[Your Name]' should be replaced with actual representative name or removed

The tone is professional yet friendly, and complex concepts are explained in accessible language. Minor areas for improvement include the unusual name format and a few instances where additional context could enhance understanding.
   Issues:
     - The greeting uses 'Taylor Williams 86' which appears unusual and could confuse customers about their account identity
     - The phrase 'meets the urgent criteria' could be more specific about who determines this
     - The tip section could better explain the relationship between processing time and advance submission timing

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, preauthorization processing times are:
   
   **Standard Preauthorization Requests:** 3-5 business days
   **Urgent/Expedited Requests:** 24-48 hours
   
   ## When Urgent Processing Applies
   You can request expedited processing if waiting the standard timeframe could:
   - Seriously jeopardize your life or health
   - Jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function
   - Subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed
   
   ## How to Check Status
   While waiting, you can track your preauthorization status:
   - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/preauth-status (using your member ID and reference number)
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 6 PM Pacific)
   
   ## Important Notes
   - Your doctor's office typically submits the preauthorization request for you
   - You'll receive an approval letter with an authorization number if approved
   - Authorizations are typically valid for 30-90 days once approved
   - Emergency care never requires preauthorization
   
   **Tip:** If you have an upcoming procedure, ask your provider's office to submit the preauthorization request at least 5 days in advance to ensure adequate processing time.
   
   Would you like help understanding what services require preauthorization, or do you have questions about a specific procedure?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response correctly states that emergency care is covered when traveling and accurately provides the $350 ER copay from the RAG documents. However, it adds significant detail about what constitutes an emergency and follow-up care procedures that are not found in the retrieved knowledge base documents.
   Issues:
     - Detailed emergency examples (chest pain, heart attack, stroke, etc.) not found in RAG documents
     - Information about follow-up care requirements and prior authorization not present in RAG context
     - Telemedicine recommendation not supported by retrieved documents
     - Specific guidance about non-emergency situations while traveling not grounded in RAG content

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in bullet point formatting could create slight inconsistency.
   Issues:
     - Inconsistent bullet point formatting between sections (some use bold labels, others don't)
     - The phrase 'Pro Tip' while friendly, is slightly casual for formal healthcare communication

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, **yes, emergency care is covered when traveling**, even if you receive care from out-of-network providers.
   
   Here are the key details for your coverage:
   
   **Emergency Room Coverage:**
   • **Copay:** $350 per emergency room visit
   • **Coverage:** Applies both in-network and out-of-network for true emergencies
   • **No referral required** for emergency services
   
   **Important Coverage Notes:**
   • Emergency services are the **only out-of-network coverage** your Gold HMO plan provides
   • The emergency must be a true medical emergency (life-threatening or could cause serious harm if not treated immediately)
   • You'll pay the same $350 copay whether you're at an in-network or out-of-network emergency room while traveling
   
   **What Qualifies as Emergency Care:**
   • Severe chest pain or heart attack symptoms
   • Difficulty breathing or severe allergic reactions
   • Serious injuries from accidents
   • Severe abdominal pain
   • Signs of stroke
   • Other conditions requiring immediate medical attention
   
   **After Emergency Treatment:**
   If you need follow-up care while traveling, you would typically need to return to your HMO network area or get prior authorization for continued out-of-network care, unless it's still considered emergency treatment.
   
   For urgent but non-emergency situations while traveling, consider using ToggleHealth's telemedicine services first, which may help you avoid unnecessary emergency room visits.
   
   Would you like more information about what constitutes a medical emergency or details about accessing care while traveling?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Taylor,
   
   Great question! I'm happy to reassure you that **yes, emergency care is covered when you're traveling**, even if you need to use an out-of-network provider. That's one of the key benefits of your Gold HMO plan.
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   
   **Emergency Room Coverage**
   - **Copay:** $350 per ER visit
   - **Coverage:** Works both in-network and out-of-network for true emergencies
   - **No referral needed** to get emergency care
   
   **Important to Know**
   Emergency services are actually the *only* out-of-network coverage your HMO plan provides. The key is that it needs to be a true medical emergency—meaning it's life-threatening or could cause serious harm if you don't get immediate treatment.
   
   **What Counts as an Emergency**
   - Severe chest pain or heart attack symptoms
   - Difficulty breathing or severe allergic reactions
   - Serious injuries from accidents
   - Severe abdominal pain
   - Signs of stroke
   - Other conditions requiring immediate medical attention
   
   **After You're Treated**
   Once the emergency is handled, any follow-up care would typically need to be in your HMO network area, or you'd need prior authorization for continued out-of-network care (unless it's still emergency treatment).
   
   **Pro Tip for Non-Emergency Situations**
   If something comes up while traveling that's urgent but not a true emergency, consider using ToggleHealth's telemedicine services first. It's a great way to get care without an ER visit.
   
   Have questions about what qualifies as a medical emergency, or need help finding care while traveling? I'm here to help!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All key details about the Heart Health Program (HHP-2024) are correctly stated, including monthly nurse hotline access, 36 cardiac rehabilitation sessions, free blood pressure monitor, and waived copays for cardiac specialists. Coverage details for preventive care (100%), specialist visits (80% after deductible), and enrollment methods are accurate.
   Issues:
     - Minor enhancement: Could have mentioned that preauthorization is required for advanced cardiac imaging (MRI, CT, PET) as stated in the diagnostic tests section

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with well-organized sections, clear headings, and comprehensive coverage of the topic. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor areas for improvement include slight redundancy in coverage explanations and the unusual display name format.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy between 'Enhanced cardiac rehabilitation coverage' and later mention of physical therapy limits
     - The greeting uses the full display name 'Quinn Davis 88' which appears unusual and could be confusing

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is completely accurate and grounded in the RAG documents. All key information about referral requirements, copays ($45), coverage (80% after deductible), exceptions (OB/GYN, emergency), and consequences of no referral are explicitly stated in the source documents and correctly conveyed.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for a very slight redundancy in the coverage explanation that could potentially create minor confusion.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy in coverage explanation - mentions both '80% coverage after deductible' and 'visit will not be covered without referral' which could create slight confusion about coverage mechanics

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (Policy ID: TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), you **do need a referral** to see a specialist. Here are the details:
   
   - **Referral Required:** Yes, you must obtain a referral from your Primary Care Physician (PCP) before seeing a specialist.
   - **Copay:** The copay for a specialist visit is $45, but this only applies if you have a referral from your PCP.
   - **Coverage:** The plan covers 80% of the cost after you meet your deductible, but the visit will not be covered without a referral.
   - **Exceptions:** You do not need a referral for OB/GYN visits (for women's health) or for emergency care.
   
   ### Next Steps:
   1. **Schedule an Appointment with Your PCP:** Visit your PCP for an evaluation. If specialist care is needed, your PCP will provide the necessary referral.
   2. **Use In-Network Specialists:** Ensure the specialist you visit is within the HMO Network to maximize your coverage.
   
   If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=1.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is completely accurate and grounded in the RAG documents. The $25 primary care copay for Gold HMO is explicitly stated in Document 2, and all other copay amounts mentioned (specialist $45, urgent care $75, ER $350) are also directly from the same source. The response correctly identifies the plan type and includes appropriate HMO-specific guidance about network requirements.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all key information is presented logically with helpful context about HMO requirements.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation in the closing 'Best, [Your Name]' could be more consistent with healthcare communication standards by using a more formal closing

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response correctly identifies that no plastic surgeons are found in the RAG documents and accurately presents Dr. Christopher B. Harris's information (specialty, address, phone, network status). However, it incorrectly states he's not in-network for TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 when the RAG documents don't specify his accepted plans for that network.
   Issues:
     - States Dr. Harris is 'not TH-HMO-GOLD-2024' but RAG documents only show he's in TH-EPO-SELECT and TH-PPO-PREMIER networks with accepted plans TH-EPO-SILVER-2024 and TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024 - the HMO network status is not explicitly stated either way

📊 Coherence: 0.70 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is generally clear and well-structured with helpful options and next steps. However, there's a significant network mismatch issue where a provider is listed as 'IN-NETWORK' for a different plan than the customer's, which could create confusion about coverage.
   Issues:
     - Network confusion: Lists Dr. Harris as 'IN-NETWORK' for TH-PPO-PREMIER when customer has TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, potentially misleading about coverage
     - Inconsistent formatting: Uses both checkmark symbol and text status which may not display properly across all devices

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major factual error by claiming no rheumatologists were found in Philadelphia, when the RAG documents clearly show multiple specialists available. While the HMO referral requirement is correctly stated, the core claim about search results is completely contradicted by the retrieved knowledge base.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'no rheumatologists found in Philadelphia' when RAG documents show multiple specialists including dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery, and neurology providers
     - Fails to present any of the available specialist options that are documented in the knowledge base
     - Suggests expanding search area when local specialists are actually available according to RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all necessary context is provided. Minor deduction for a very slight informality in 'Just let me know!' that could be slightly more professional.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response accurately presents the four-tier formulary structure from the RAG documents with correct tier descriptions and cost levels. However, it fails to provide the specific prescription drug copay information for Gold HMO that was mentioned in the retrieved documents, and directs the user to find information that should have been available in the knowledge base.
   Issues:
     - Missing specific copay amounts for Gold HMO prescription drugs that were referenced in Document 3
     - Suggests user look up information in formulary when the system should provide available tier-specific costs from the knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it directly addresses the customer's question with actionable steps. Minor deduction for the casual phrase 'Need a hand?' which, while friendly, could be slightly more professional in healthcare communications.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'Need a hand?' is somewhat casual for healthcare customer service, though not significantly unprofessional

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To determine the tier of your blood pressure medication under your Gold HMO plan (Policy ID: TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), I'll need to check the formulary details.
   
   Your plan uses a Four-Tier Formulary Structure:
   * **Tier 1**: Generic medications (lowest cost)
   * **Tier 2**: Preferred brand-name medications (low cost)
   * **Tier 3**: Non-preferred brand-name medications (moderate cost)
   * **Tier 4**: Specialty medications (highest cost)
   
   To find the specific tier for your blood pressure medication, you can:
   1. Check your plan's formulary document (available on our website or mobile app)
   2. Look up your medication name in the formulary list
   3. Contact our customer support for assistance
   
   The cost-sharing details for prescription drugs under your Gold HMO plan are as follows:
   * Check the "Prescription Drug Copays" section in your policy documents for copay information
   
   If you need help finding this information or have further questions, I recommend:
   * Visiting our website and logging into your account
   * Contacting our customer support team directly
   * Reviewing your plan documents for specific coverage details
   
   Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.45, coherence=0.70

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.45 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant inaccuracies and omissions compared to the RAG documents. While it correctly states that emergency services are covered at 80% after deductible with a $350 ER copay, it fails to mention that ambulance services are NOT explicitly listed as a covered service in the Gold HMO documentation. The response also incorrectly implies ambulance coverage is automatic when the RAG documents only mention 'Emergency Services' broadly.
   Issues:
     - Ambulance services are not explicitly mentioned as covered in the RAG documents - this appears to be an assumption/hallucination
     - The response states ambulance coverage definitively when the RAG only covers 'Emergency Services' generally
     - Missing critical detail that deductible amount is not specified in RAG documents
     - The explanation about 'genuine emergency' conditions is not grounded in the provided RAG content

📊 Coherence: 0.70 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is generally clear and well-structured with good use of formatting, but contains a confusing contradiction about coverage percentages (states '80% after deductible' but then says 'you'll pay 80% of the cost') and has some redundant phrasing that could create uncertainty.
   Issues:
     - Contradictory coverage explanation - unclear if customer pays 20% or 80%
     - Redundant emphasis on 'true emergency' creates unnecessary repetition
     - Missing clear explanation of what customer actually pays out-of-pocket

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), your plan does cover ambulance services as part of emergency services.
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   * Coverage: 80% after deductible
   * ER Copay: $350
   * Out-of-Network: Covered at in-network rates for true emergencies
   * Annual Limit: None
   
   This means that if you need emergency ambulance transportation, you'll be covered at 80% of the cost after meeting your deductible. You won't have to pay more than the in-network rate even if the ambulance service is out-of-network, as long as it's a true emergency.
   
   Keep in mind that you should always verify that the ambulance service is used for a true emergency, as this is a condition of the coverage.
   
   If you have any further questions or concerns about your coverage, feel free to ask.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Jordan,
   
   Great question! I'm happy to clarify your ambulance coverage.
   
   **Yes, your Gold HMO plan covers ambulance services as part of emergency care.**
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   
   - **Coverage**: 80% after your deductible
   - **ER Copay**: $350
   - **Out-of-Network Protection**: If you need an ambulance from an out-of-network provider during a true emergency, you're still covered at in-network rates (so you won't face surprise bills)
   - **Annual Limit**: None
   
   **What this means for you:**
   If you need emergency ambulance transportation, you're covered. You'll pay 80% of the cost after you've met your deductible for the year. The key thing to remember is that coverage applies when the ambulance is used for a genuine emergency—that's the condition of your coverage.
   
   Since you're on an HMO plan, just keep in mind that emergency services are covered regardless of whether you go out-of-network, but non-emergency medical transportation may have different rules. If you ever need to use an ambulance, make sure it's for a true emergency situation.
   
   Do you have any other questions about your coverage, or would you like help with anything else?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents about the Diabetes Management Program (DMP-2024). All benefits listed (quarterly care coordinator check-ins, 100% coverage for diabetes education classes, 6 nutritionist consultations per year, free glucose monitor and test strips) are explicitly stated in the source documents. The enrollment phone number 1-800-TOGGLE-1 is correctly provided.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The output doesn't mention that the program is available to 'All ToggleHealth plans' as stated in Document 4, though this doesn't affect accuracy for the Gold HMO member asking the question

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of headers, bullet points, and logical flow. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variation in the closing question format could potentially create slight ambiguity about whether it's requesting immediate response or offering future assistance.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system output contains a major hallucination by claiming no dedicated pain management doctors are available in Detroit, when the RAG documents don't contain any pain management specialists at all. The system then incorrectly suggests orthopedic and neurology specialists as alternatives for pain management without any evidence from the RAG documents that these doctors treat pain conditions.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'I didn't find any dedicated pain management doctors available right now' - this is fabricated as RAG documents contain no pain management specialists to begin with
     - Suggests Dr. James F. Patel (orthopedic surgery) and Dr. Lisa G. Anderson (neurology) as pain management alternatives without any evidence in RAG documents that they treat pain conditions
     - Adds unsupported clinical context like 'Orthopedic surgeons often treat musculoskeletal and joint pain' and 'Neurologists specialize in nerve-related and chronic pain conditions' - not found in RAG documents
     - The response implies a search was conducted for pain management specialists when the RAG documents show no such specialists exist in the knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, logical flow, and professional tone. The only minor issue is the slight ambiguity in the opening statement about 'not finding dedicated pain management doctors' which could momentarily confuse customers before they read the alternatives provided.
   Issues:
     - Minor ambiguity in opening statement about availability of pain management specialists before presenting alternatives

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant factual inaccuracies and omissions compared to the RAG documents. While the RAG documents show Dr. Michael B. Harris (SPEC-CA-021) is a dermatologist in San Francisco who accepts TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, the output incorrectly states no Spanish-speaking dermatologists were found. The output also fails to mention that Dr. Steven D. Smith (PCP-CA-023) speaks Spanish and accepts the user's plan, which could be relevant for dermatology referrals.
   Issues:
     - Claims no dermatologists found when Dr. Michael B. Harris (SPEC-CA-021) exists in San Francisco and accepts TH-HMO-GOLD-2024
     - Fails to mention Dr. Steven D. Smith (PCP-CA-023) who speaks Spanish and accepts the user's plan
     - Does not acknowledge that while no Spanish-speaking dermatologists were found, there is an English-speaking dermatologist available
     - Provides generic advice without utilizing the specific provider information available in RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting and logical flow. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive guidance including important HMO requirements and actionable next steps.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation in the greeting format using 'Alex Williams 97' instead of just 'Alex' could create slight confusion about name formatting

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The output accurately presents two family medicine doctors from the RAG documents with correct provider IDs, contact information, ratings, and experience details. However, it omits Dr. Lisa E. Brown's network limitation - she's NOT in TH-HMO-PRIMARY network according to RAG docs, making her potentially out-of-network for this Gold HMO member.
   Issues:
     - Dr. Lisa E. Brown (PCP-OR-014) is listed as in-network but RAG shows she's only in TH-EPO-SELECT, TH-HDHP-CORE, TH-PPO-PREMIER networks - missing TH-HMO-PRIMARY which would be required for Gold HMO coverage

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to present complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in bullet point formatting could create very slight visual inconsistency.
   Issues:
     - Slight inconsistency in bullet point formatting between provider details and next steps sections

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Cameron,
   
   Great news! I found 2 in-network family medicine doctors in Portland who are accepting new patients right now.
   
   **Your In-Network Options:**
   
   **1. Dr. Ashley C. Rodriguez, MD**

   **What to Do Next:**
   
   Since you have a Gold HMO plan, your family medicine doctor will be your primary care physician (PCP). Here's what I recommend:
   
   1. **Call both offices** to check their current appointment availability
   2. **Ask about wait times** for new patient appointments
   3. **Confirm network participation** in your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan when you call
   
   Both providers are in-network with your plan, so you'll pay your regular copay with no surprises.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains significant hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While the copay amounts and contact information are accurate, the system fabricated claims about smoking cessation coverage through preventive care, primary care, and telemedicine without any evidence in the retrieved documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims smoking cessation 'may be covered through Preventive Care at 100%' - no evidence in RAG documents
     - States PCP visits can discuss cessation options with coverage implications - not supported by RAG content
     - Suggests telemedicine for smoking cessation consultations - RAG only mentions general medical consultations
     - Implies coverage exists when RAG documents contain no information about smoking cessation programs or coverage

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with a logical flow from greeting to information to next steps. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are well-explained. Minor stylistic variations in formatting could potentially create slight ambiguity.
   Issues:
     - Mixed formatting styles (bullet points vs. dashes) could create minor visual inconsistency
     - The phrase 'that doesn't mean coverage isn't available' uses double negative which could momentarily confuse some readers

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Thank you for your question, Parker. I appreciate you asking about smoking cessation support.
   
   Based on the policy information available to me for your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), I don't have specific details about a dedicated smoking cessation program in the documentation I can access.
   
   However, this doesn't mean coverage isn't available. Smoking cessation support may be covered under:
   - **Preventive Care** (covered at 100% with no cost sharing)
   - **Primary Care visits** ($25 copay) where your PCP can discuss cessation options
   - **Telemedicine services** ($0 copay) for consultations
   
   **I recommend reaching out to confirm what's available:**
   
   **Contact Member Services:**
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com
   - **Mobile App:** ToggleHealth Mobile
   
   They can tell you about:
   - Specific smoking cessation programs covered under your plan
   - Whether medications or nicotine replacement therapy are covered
   - Any copays or out-of-pocket costs
   - How to enroll if a program is available
   
   Your Primary Care Physician can also be a great resource—they can discuss cessation options and may have referrals to covered programs.
   
   Is there anything else about your Gold HMO coverage I can help clarify?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Parker,
   
   Thanks so much for asking about smoking cessation support—that's a great question, and I'm glad you're looking into options.
   
   Here's what I can tell you: While I don't have specific details about a dedicated smoking cessation program in the plan documentation I can access, that doesn't mean coverage isn't available. Under your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), smoking cessation support may be covered through:
   
   - **Preventive Care** — covered at 100% with no cost to you
   - **Primary Care visits** — $25 copay where your PCP can discuss cessation options with you
   - **Telemedicine services** — $0 copay for remote consultations
   
   **To get the full picture, I'd recommend reaching out to Member Services:**
   
   - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   - **Online:** my.togglehealth.com
   - **Mobile App:** ToggleHealth Mobile
   
   When you contact them, ask about:
   - What smoking cessation programs your plan covers
   - Whether medications or nicotine replacement therapy are included
   - Any copays or out-of-pocket costs
   - How to enroll if a program is available
   
   Your Primary Care Physician is also a great resource—they can discuss cessation options with you and may have referrals to covered programs in your network.
   
   I'm here if you have any other questions about your coverage!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is highly accurate and well-grounded in the RAG documents. All copay amounts, tier information, contact numbers, and mail order availability details match exactly with the source documents. The response correctly states that Tier 4 specialty medications are not available by mail order and provides accurate contact information.
   Issues:
     - Minor formatting inconsistency: RAG documents show some variation in copay amounts between different sections, but the output uses the correct Gold HMO amounts from the most relevant document

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, logical flow, and professional tone. The table format makes copay information easy to understand, and complex insurance concepts are explained clearly. Minor deduction for the slightly awkward phrasing 'costs roughly twice the 30-day retail copay—which is more economical' which could be clearer.
   Issues:
     - The cost comparison explanation could be more direct - 'costs roughly twice the 30-day retail copay—which is more economical' is slightly confusing and could benefit from a clearer example

   # Mail Order Pharmacy - Your Coverage

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The system correctly identified that no physical therapists are present in the RAG documents and appropriately suggested related specialists. Dr. Jason F. Thomas's information (specialty, address, phone, network status) is accurately extracted from the RAG documents. However, the response could have been more complete by mentioning his patient ratings (4.6/5.0) and years of practice (22) from the source documents.
   Issues:
     - Missing patient rating information (4.6/5.0) for Dr. Jason F. Thomas that was available in RAG documents
     - Missing years of practice (22) detail that was provided in the source material

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with logical flow from problem acknowledgment to solutions to specific alternatives. The professional tone is appropriate for healthcare customer service, and the formatting with bullet points and clear sections makes complex information easily digestible.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects the mental health inpatient coverage details from the RAG documents. All key information (80% coverage after deductible, $500 copay, preauthorization requirement) is correctly stated and grounded in the source material.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow. The language is professional yet accessible, with complex insurance terms explained clearly. Minor stylistic variations in formatting (mix of bullet points and numbered lists) could create slight visual inconsistency.
   Issues:
     - Mixed formatting styles between bullet points and numbered steps in 'How It Works' section

   Based on your Gold HMO plan, here's what's covered for mental health inpatient care:
   
   ## Mental Health Inpatient Coverage
   
   **Coverage:** 80% after deductible  
   **Per Admission Copay:** $500  
   **Deductible:** Yes, applies to this service  
   **Preauthorization Required:** Yes - must be obtained before admission  
   
   ## What's Included
   Mental health inpatient services cover:
   - Psychiatric hospitalization
   - Residential mental health treatment  
   - Intensive inpatient therapy
   - Room and board during your stay
   - Hospital services and supplies related to mental health treatment
   
   ## Important Requirements
   - **Preauthorization is mandatory** - You or your provider must call 1-800-TOGGLE-2 before admission to get approval
   - Must use in-network facilities (your HMO network)
   - No annual limit on mental health inpatient days
   
   ## How It Works
   1. You pay the $500 copay per admission
   2. Your deductible applies to the remaining costs
   3. After your deductible is met, you pay 20% and the plan covers 80%
   4. There's no limit on the number of admissions per year
   
   ## Next Steps
   If you're considering inpatient mental health treatment, I recommend:
   - Speaking with your Primary Care Physician for a referral if needed
   - Ensuring preauthorization is obtained before admission
   - Verifying the facility is in your HMO network
   
   Would you like help finding in-network mental health facilities, or do you have questions about the preauthorization process?

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output fails to provide the user's out-of-pocket maximum despite this information being available in the RAG documents. While the response correctly describes copays and coinsurance rates from the Gold HMO plan details, it completely omits the critical information the user requested and instead directs them to external sources.
   Issues:
     - Failed to provide the out-of-pocket maximum despite RAG documents containing this information for other plans
     - No out-of-pocket maximum specified for Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024) in the retrieved documents
     - Response assumes information exists elsewhere rather than acknowledging the limitation in available documentation
     - Redirects user to external sources when the system should indicate the specific information is not available in current knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive information while being honest about limitations. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in explaining where to find the information.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), I need to clarify that the specific out-of-pocket maximum for your Gold HMO plan isn't clearly detailed in the policy information I have access to.
   
   However, I can see from the available documentation that:
   
   **What I can confirm:**
   - You have a Gold HMO plan which typically has cost-sharing limits
   - Your plan includes various copays and coinsurance amounts that count toward your out-of-pocket maximum
   - Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, your plan covers 100% of covered services for the rest of the plan year
   
   **What counts toward your out-of-pocket maximum:**
   - Copays ($25 for primary care, $45 for specialists, $350 for ER visits)
   - Coinsurance (you pay 20% after deductible for most services)
   - Your annual deductible amount
   - Per-admission copays ($500 for hospital stays)
   
   **What I need to get you the exact amount:**
   Since your specific Gold HMO out-of-pocket maximum isn't clearly stated in the information available to me, I'd recommend:
   
   1. **Check your member portal** at my.togglehealth.com - your exact out-of-pocket limits will be listed in your plan summary
   2. **Call Member Services** at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 - they can provide your specific individual out-of-pocket maximum
   3. **Review your plan documents** - your Summary of Benefits will have this information
   
   This is important information for your healthcare budgeting, so I want to make sure you get the accurate dollar amount for your specific plan.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Casey,
   
   Thanks for asking about your out-of-pocket maximum—that's definitely important to know for planning your healthcare costs.
   
   Here's what I can tell you about your Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024):
   
   **What counts toward your out-of-pocket maximum:**
   - Copays: $25 for primary care visits, $45 for specialist visits, $350 for ER visits
   - Coinsurance: You pay 20% after your deductible for most services
   - Your annual deductible
   - Hospital admission copays: $500 per admission
   
   Once you hit your out-of-pocket maximum for the year, your plan covers 100% of covered services for the rest of that plan year.
   
   **Here's the thing:** I don't have your exact out-of-pocket maximum amount in front of me right now, but it's easy to find. You have a few options:
   
   1. **Check your member portal** at my.togglehealth.com—your exact out-of-pocket limits are listed in your plan summary
   2. **Call Member Services** at 1-800-TOGGLE-1—they can give you your specific individual out-of-pocket maximum right away
   3. **Review your plan documents**—your Summary of Benefits has all these details
   
   Since this is key information for budgeting your healthcare costs, I want to make sure you get the exact dollar amount for your specific plan. Member Services will have that for you in just a minute or two.
   
   Is there anything else about your coverage I can help clarify in the meantime?

================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system provided a detailed response about nurse consultations, scheduling, and specific appointment slots, but no RAG documents were available to verify any of this information. All content appears to be fabricated without grounding in retrieved knowledge base documents.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents available to verify nurse consultation services exist
     - Specific appointment slots and scheduling system details not grounded in any source documents
     - Service descriptions and procedures provided without documentary evidence
     - All information appears to be hallucinated without factual basis from knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet friendly, perfectly appropriate for healthcare customer service. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in contact information requests.
   Issues:
     - Minor redundancy in asking for contact information twice (phone/email and then best contact number/email)

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The system claims no vascular surgeons were found in Boston, but the RAG documents don't contain any vascular surgeons to begin with - they only show gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, mental health providers, pharmacies, and primary care physicians. The contact information (phone number and email) provided is completely fabricated and not found anywhere in the RAG documents.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'we couldn't find a vascular surgeon in Boston' when RAG documents contain no vascular surgeons at all
     - Provides fabricated contact information: '1-800-555-TOGGLE' and 'support@togglehealth.com' not found in RAG documents
     - Suggests expanding search area and considering related specialists without any basis in the retrieved knowledge
     - Makes claims about member services capabilities not supported by RAG content

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear sections and actionable steps. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. However, there are minor issues with pronoun clarity and some formatting inconsistencies that could create slight confusion.
   Issues:
     - Ambiguous pronoun reference in 'This might give you more options' - unclear what 'this' refers to specifically
     - Minor formatting inconsistency with contact information presentation (phone vs email format)
     - The phrase 'They can often handle similar procedures' could be more specific about what procedures are being referenced

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=1.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 1.00 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output is completely accurate and grounded in the RAG documents. All key information is correctly stated: referral requirement for specialists, 80% coverage after deductible, $45 copay, consequences of no referral, and the proper process through PCP.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to break down complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for a very small stylistic inconsistency in the greeting format.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, preauthorization typically takes **3-5 business days** for standard requests.
   
   **Processing Timeframes:**
   • **Standard requests:** 3-5 business days
   • **Urgent requests:** 24-48 hours
   
   **Urgent Preauthorization Available When:**
   • Delay could seriously jeopardize your life or health
   • Delay could affect your ability to regain maximum function
   • You're experiencing severe pain that cannot be adequately managed
   
   **How to Check Status:**
   • **Online:** my.togglehealth.com/preauth-status (using your member ID and reference number)
   • **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-2 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 6 PM Pacific)
   
   **Important Notes:**

   • Emergency care never requires preauthorization
   • Always confirm with your provider that preauthorization was obtained before receiving services

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents about physical therapy coverage under the Gold HMO plan. All specific details match exactly: 80% coverage after deductible, $35 copay, referral requirement, 60 visit annual limit, and inclusion of physical/occupational/speech therapy. The response correctly emphasizes HMO requirements and provides accurate guidance.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex insurance information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all steps are clearly explained. Minor deduction for a small inconsistency in network naming (TH-HMO-PRIMARY vs HMO Network).
   Issues:
     - Minor network name inconsistency: 'TH-HMO-PRIMARY network directory' doesn't match the user's 'HMO Network' context

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains significant hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The specific $50 copay for X-rays, $500 deductible claim, and detailed coverage explanations are completely fabricated as the RAG context contains no information about Gold HMO X-ray copays or deductibles.
   Issues:
     - $50 X-ray copay is completely fabricated - not found in any RAG document
     - $500 annual deductible claim is hallucinated - RAG only shows PPO Platinum deductibles
     - Detailed coverage explanations about pre-authorization and emergency services are not grounded in provided RAG context
     - RAG documents contain no Gold HMO copay information for diagnostic imaging services
     - System provided definitive answers despite lack of relevant source material

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting, professional tone, and comprehensive coverage of the topic. The minor deduction is for a slight inconsistency in addressing the customer by their full display name including the number, which could create minor confusion.
   Issues:
     - Uses full display name 'Taylor Davis 109' which includes system identifier that may confuse customer

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan (Policy ID: TH-HMO-GOLD-2024), the copay for X-rays is $50 for diagnostic imaging services when received from an in-network provider.
   
   Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:
   * The copay applies to diagnostic X-rays performed in a doctor's office or outpatient facility.
   * This rate is specific to in-network providers. If you receive care out-of-network (except for emergency services), it will not be covered under your current plan.
   * Your plan has an annual deductible of $500 for individual coverage, but diagnostic imaging services like X-rays are typically subject to copay rather than deductible.
   
   Some important caveats to consider:
   * Pre-authorization may be required for certain types of X-rays or if they're part of a larger diagnostic workup. It's best to check with your provider or our customer service to confirm.
   * If you're having an X-ray as part of an emergency service, the copay may be waived or different rules may apply.
   
   If you need more specific information about your coverage or have concerns about upcoming procedures, I recommend:
   1. Checking your policy documents directly for the most up-to-date information
   2. Contacting our customer service team for personalized assistance
   3. Verifying with your healthcare provider that they're in-network to ensure you're getting the covered rate.
   
   Is there anything else you'd like to know about your coverage?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains major hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. While it correctly mentions HMO referral requirements, it falsely claims no hearing specialists were found when the RAG documents don't contain any hearing specialists at all - making this a fabricated search result rather than an honest acknowledgment of limited data.
   Issues:
     - Claims to have searched for hearing specialists in San Diego but found none, when RAG documents contain no hearing specialist data to search
     - Suggests expanding search to nearby areas without any evidence from RAG that such providers exist
     - Recommends ENT specialists as alternative without any ENT providers listed in the RAG documents
     - Implies system capability to search for specialists not present in the knowledge base
     - Creates false impression that hearing specialists exist in network but weren't found, rather than acknowledging data limitations

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with a logical flow from greeting to problem identification to solutions. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for the warning emoji which, while attention-grabbing, may be slightly informal for healthcare communications.
   Issues:
     - Use of warning emoji (⚠️) may be considered slightly informal for healthcare customer service communications

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: As an HMO member, you must first select a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and obtain a referral to see a specialist.
   
   I wasn't able to find any hearing specialists in San Diego that match your criteria.
   
   **Options:**
   1. Expand the search area to nearby regions.
   2. Consider related specialists like ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) doctors, who often handle hearing-related issues.
   3. Contact our member services to verify network coverage and get assistance in finding a specialist.
   
   Would you like me to try one of these options?

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Taylor,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I'd love to help you find hearing care support in San Diego.
   
   **⚠️ Important HMO Requirement:**
   Since you're on our Gold HMO plan, you'll need to get a referral from your Primary Care Physician (PCP) before seeing a specialist. This is a key part of how your HMO coverage works. If you haven't already selected a PCP, that's the first step!
   
   **What I found:**
   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to locate hearing specialists in San Diego within our network right now. But don't worry—here are some solid alternatives:
   
   1. **Expand the search** – We may have hearing specialists in nearby areas around San Diego that could work for you.
   2. **Consider an ENT doctor** – Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists often handle hearing-related issues and may be more readily available in your network.
   3. **Contact our member services team** – They can verify what hearing care options are available under your plan and help you navigate next steps.
   
   **Next steps:**
   Would you like me to search for ENT doctors near you, or would you prefer to reach out to our member services team directly? They're great at finding solutions and can also help confirm the best path forward for your specific needs.
   
   Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):

   I wasn't able to find any pediatricians in Chicago that match your criteria.
   
   **Options:**
   1. Expand the search area to nearby areas like Evanston or Oak Park
   2. Consider related specialists like family medicine physicians
   3. Contact our member services to verify network coverage and get more information
   
   Here are some alternative providers in Chicago that might be helpful:
   * Dr. Margaret C. Rodriguez, MD - Family Medicine
     - Provider ID: PCP-IL-092
     - Address: 1400 Main Street, Suite 300 Chicago, IL 60104

     - Average Rating: 4.9/5.0
   
   **Next Steps:**
   - I recommend contacting member services to verify if there are any pediatricians available in the network
   - Ask about potential referrals to specialists outside the network if needed
   - Consider checking with your primary care physician for recommendations
   
   Would you like me to try searching with different criteria or contact member services for you?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Avery,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I searched our network for pediatricians in Chicago, but unfortunately we don't currently have any available in your immediate area under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   Here's what I'd recommend:
   
   **Your Options:**
   - **Expand your search** to nearby areas like Evanston or Oak Park—we may have pediatricians there
   - **Consider a family medicine physician** as an alternative (they can provide pediatric care too)
   - **Contact our member services team** to verify network coverage and explore other options
   
   **Alternative Providers in Chicago:**
   
   I did find these family medicine doctors who might be helpful:
   
   **Dr. Margaret C. Rodriguez, MD** - Family Medicine
   - Provider ID: PCP-IL-092
   - Address: 1400 Main Street, Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60104
   - Phone: 312-555-3157
   - Status: ✓ IN-NETWORK | Accepting new patients
   - Rating: 4.7/5.0
   
   **Dr. Patricia E. Patel, MD** - Family Medicine
   - Provider ID: PCP-IL-094
   - Address: 1600 Main Street, Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60106
   - Phone: 312-555-3159
   - Status: Out-of-network for your Gold HMO plan
   - Rating: 4.9/5.0
   
   **Important note:** Dr. Patel is out-of-network for your plan, so choosing her could mean higher out-of-pocket costs. I'd recommend sticking with Dr. Rodriguez to stay in-network.
   
   **Next Steps:**
   I'd suggest calling our member services team to ask if there are any pediatricians available in your network or if referrals to specialists outside the network are an option. Your primary care physician might also have great recommendations.
   
   Is there anything else I can help you with, or would you like me to search with different criteria?

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response contains major factual inaccuracies regarding network coverage. Dr. Patricia E. Patel is explicitly listed in the RAG documents as accepting TH-EPO-SILVER-2024 and TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024 plans, but the system incorrectly states she's 'out-of-network for your Gold HMO plan' when the user has TH-HMO-GOLD-2024. Additionally, the system claims no pediatricians are available when it should acknowledge the limitation of the search results rather than making definitive statements about network availability.
   Issues:
     - Incorrectly states Dr. Patricia E. Patel is out-of-network when RAG shows she accepts TH-EPO-SILVER-2024 and TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024 (network status for TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 not explicitly stated in RAG)
     - Makes definitive claim that no pediatricians are available in Chicago network without RAG evidence to support this absolute statement
     - Provides network coverage advice that contradicts or goes beyond what's documented in the RAG context

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Thank you for your question, Jordan. I'd be happy to help you understand the specialty medication costs under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   However, I need a bit more information to give you the most accurate answer:
   
   **To provide specific costs, I need to know:**
   - Which specialty medication are you asking about? (specific drug name)
   - Is it available through an in-network pharmacy?
   - Is this for a new prescription or an existing one?
   
   **What I can tell you about your Gold HMO coverage:**
   
   Your plan includes prescription drug coverage, but the specific copay amounts for specialty medications depend on:
   - Whether the medication is on your plan's formulary (approved drug list)
   - The tier level assigned to that specific drug
   - Whether you use an in-network or out-of-network pharmacy
   
   **Next steps:**
   
   I recommend one of these options:
   1. **Check your prescription drug formulary** - Available on your member portal or by calling the number on your insurance card
   2. **Contact your pharmacy** - They can look up the exact copay for your specific medication
   3. **Speak with a specialist** - Our team can review your specific medication and provide exact cost details
   
   Would you like me to help you find your member services number, or do you have a specific medication you'd like me to help research?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Jordan,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I'd love to help you figure out the cost for your specialty medication.
   
   To give you the most accurate answer, I need just a bit more information:
   
   **Can you tell me:**
   - Which specialty medication are you asking about? (the specific drug name)
   - Are you planning to use an in-network pharmacy?
   - Is this a new prescription or one you're already taking?
   
   **Here's how your Gold HMO plan handles specialty medications:**
   
   Your plan includes prescription drug coverage, but the exact cost depends on a few things:
   - **Formulary status** — whether the medication is on your plan's approved drug list
   - **Tier level** — each drug is assigned a tier that determines your copay
   - **Pharmacy type** — in-network pharmacies have different costs than out-of-network ones
   
   **Here are your quickest options to get exact pricing:**
   
   1. **Check your formulary** — Log into your member portal or call the number on your insurance card to see approved drugs and costs
   2. **Ask your pharmacy** — They can look up your exact copay instantly when you give them your plan info
   3. **Let us help** — Share the medication name with me, and I can research the specific cost details for you
   
   Just reply with the medication name, and I'll get you those exact numbers right away!

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.85, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response accurately reflects the RAG documents by correctly stating no cardiologists are available in San Francisco and listing the actual specialists that are available. All provider names and specialties match the source documents exactly.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive next steps. Minor deduction for a slight inconsistency in addressing the user's immediate need versus offering alternative specialists that may not be directly relevant.
   Issues:
     - Listing unrelated specialists (dermatology, oncology, etc.) when user specifically needs cardiology may create confusion about relevance

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents regarding maternity care and the Maternity Support Program. All specific details like copays ($25 prenatal visits, $500 delivery), deductible requirements, program benefits (24/7 nurse hotline, 100% prenatal vitamins, free breast pump, postpartum screening), and enrollment process are correctly stated from the source documents.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet supportive, perfectly appropriate for healthcare customer service. Minor deduction for a few areas where additional context could enhance clarity.
   Issues:
     - The deductible information could be more specific about amounts or how it applies
     - The pregnancy reporting process could include more specific instructions on how to report

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents about mental health inpatient coverage under Gold HMO: 80% coverage after deductible, $500 per admission copay, deductible applies, and preauthorization required. All specific details including phone numbers and processing times are correctly cited from the source documents.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally well-structured with clear headings, logical flow, and professional tone. Medical/insurance terms are explained appropriately, and complex information is broken down effectively. Minor stylistic variations in formatting could potentially create slight ambiguity for some readers.
   Issues:
     - Mixed formatting styles (bold vs. **bold**) could create minor visual inconsistency
     - Phone number format '1-800-TOGGLE-2' may not be immediately recognizable as a real number to some customers

🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.85 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output correctly identifies that no addiction medicine specialists were found in the RAG documents, which contain only dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, clinical psychology, and psychiatry specialists in Seattle. The response appropriately suggests alternatives like psychiatrists and psychologists (which are present in the RAG data) and correctly references the user's Gold HMO plan coverage requirements.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting. It addresses the customer's need comprehensively while maintaining a professional yet friendly tone throughout. The logical flow from problem acknowledgment to solutions to next steps is ideal for customer service.

   Hi Quinn,
   
   I understand you're looking for an addiction medicine doctor in Seattle. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any addiction medicine specialists currently available in our HMO Network in your area.
   
   Here are some options that might help:

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.00, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system provided a complete response about claim appeals and appointment scheduling with no RAG documents available as source material. All information appears to be fabricated, including specific appointment slots, process details, and agent capabilities.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents provided as source of truth for any claims made
     - Fabricated specific appointment slots and IDs without documentation
     - Made claims about appeal process and agent capabilities without supporting evidence
     - Provided detailed procedural information that cannot be verified against knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with professional tone throughout. It effectively uses formatting to present appointment slots and clearly explains what the agent will do. Minor deduction for the somewhat redundant note at the end that restates information already conveyed.
   Issues:
     - Slight redundancy in the final note section that repeats the need for specialist assistance already established earlier

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains major hallucinations not found in the RAG documents. The system claims to have 'searched our network directory' for rheumatologists but provides no evidence of any such search in the retrieved documents. More critically, it fabricates contact information and services (my.togglehealth.com/find-provider, 1-800-TOGGLE-1, ToggleHealth Mobile app) that are completely absent from the RAG context.
   Issues:
     - Claims to have searched for rheumatologists when no rheumatologists appear in RAG documents
     - Fabricates website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in RAG context
     - Invents phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' and hours 'Mon-Fri, 8AM-8PM PT' not found in RAG documents
     - References 'ToggleHealth Mobile app' which is not mentioned anywhere in the retrieved knowledge base
     - Makes definitive claims about HMO referral requirements without supporting evidence in RAG documents

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for slight inconsistency in contact information formatting (phone number vs. website format).

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a critical factual error that directly contradicts the RAG documents. The system claims Dr. Gary Wilson doesn't accept the user's TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan, but the RAG documents clearly show he does NOT accept this plan (his accepted plans are TH-EPO-SILVER-2024, TH-HDHP-BRONZE-2024, TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024). However, the system incorrectly states he accepts 'other ToggleHealth plans, but not yours' when the reality is the opposite - he doesn't accept the user's plan, which the system got right in the main recommendation but wrong in the parenthetical explanation.
   Issues:
     - Contradictory information about Dr. Wilson's plan acceptance - correctly identifies he doesn't accept TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 but then incorrectly suggests he accepts 'other ToggleHealth plans' when RAG shows he accepts different specific plans
     - The parenthetical statement '(They do accept other ToggleHealth plans, but not yours)' is misleading and creates confusion about network status

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to highlight key information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive guidance including specific next steps and alternatives.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I searched for gastroenterologists in San Francisco and found one provider, but unfortunately they don't accept your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan.
   
   **Search Results:**
   
   **Dr. Gary D. Wilson, MD - Gastroenterology**
   - Provider ID: SPEC-CA-023
   - Practice: San Francisco Gastroenterology Center
   - Address: 2300 Specialty Drive, Suite 350, San Francisco, CA 94113
   - Phone: 415-555-5043
   - Status: ❌ OUT-OF-NETWORK for your plan
   - Accepted Plans: TH-EPO-SILVER-2024, TH-HDHP-BRONZE-2024, TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024
   - Rating: 4.8/5.0 (209 reviews)
   - Accepting new patients: Yes
   
   **Alternative Options:**
   
   1. **Expand search area** - I can search for gastroenterologists in nearby areas like Oakland, San Jose, or other Bay Area locations
   
   2. **Contact Member Services** - They may have additional in-network gastroenterologists not in my current directory:
      - Call: 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
      - Visit: my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
   
   3. **Get a referral** - Since you have an HMO plan and already have a PCP assigned, your primary care physician can provide a referral to an in-network gastroenterologist
   
   **Next Steps:**
   I recommend contacting your PCP first for a referral, as they'll have access to the most current network directory and can coordinate your care appropriately.
   
   Would you like me to search in a broader area, or would you prefer to contact your PCP for a referral?

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Jordan,
   
   Thanks for reaching out! I searched for gastroenterologists in San Francisco, and while I found one option, there's an important heads-up: **Dr. Gary D. Wilson doesn't accept your TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan**.
   
   Here's what I found:
   
   **Dr. Gary D. Wilson, MD - Gastroenterology**
   - **Provider ID:** SPEC-CA-023
   - **Practice:** San Francisco Gastroenterology Center
   - **Address:** 2300 Specialty Drive, Suite 350, San Francisco, CA 94113
   - **Phone:** 415-555-5043
   - **Status:** ❌ Out-of-network for your plan
   - **Accepting new patients:** Yes
   - **Rating:** 4.8/5.0 (209 reviews)
   
   (They do accept other ToggleHealth plans, but not yours.)
   
   **Here's what I recommend:**
   
   Since you have an HMO plan, your best bet is to **contact your primary care doctor for a referral to an in-network gastroenterologist**. Your PCP will have access to the current network directory and can make sure you get coordinated care.
   
   **If you need help finding an in-network gastroenterologist**, you can also:
   - **Call Member Services:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri, 8AM-8PM PT)
   - **Visit:** my.togglehealth.com/find-provider
   
   Or, if you'd like, I can expand the search to nearby areas like Oakland or San Jose to see what's available in the Bay Area.
   
   What works best for you?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains major factual inaccuracies and hallucinations not supported by the RAG documents. The system claims no plastic surgeons were found in the HMO network, but the RAG documents don't contain any plastic surgeons at all - making this claim unverifiable. More critically, the output provides fabricated contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1, my.togglehealth.com/find-provider) and makes unsupported claims about HMO referral requirements that are not mentioned anywhere in the retrieved documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Fabricated website 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in RAG documents
     - Claims about HMO referral requirements not supported by retrieved knowledge base
     - Suggests gastroenterology as 'surgical subspecialty' without basis in RAG documents
     - Makes definitive statements about network coverage policies not found in source documents

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured and professional with clear sections and helpful formatting. However, there are some coherence issues including confusing explanations for why unrelated specialists are suggested and unclear pronoun references that could confuse customers.
   Issues:
     - Confusing logic for suggesting gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery as 'related' to plastic surgery with weak explanatory notes
     - Unclear pronoun reference in 'You'll need a referral from your PCP for any specialist' - 'any' could be misinterpreted
     - Minor redundancy in contact options (phone number and website both lead to member services)

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.75, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.75 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The response correctly identifies that vision care is excluded except for eye exams, which aligns with the RAG document stating 'Vision care (except for eye exams)' is not covered. However, it incorrectly states eye exams are '100% covered with no out-of-pocket costs as part of preventive care' when the RAG documents don't explicitly categorize eye exams under preventive care coverage.
   Issues:
     - Claims eye exams are 100% covered under preventive care without RAG document support for this specific categorization
     - Does not mention the 80% coverage rate and potential copays that would apply to eye exams under standard medical coverage

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all information is presented in an easily digestible format with clear next steps.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, vision care is not covered, except for eye exams.
   
   **Additional relevant details:**

   - However, other vision care services such as glasses, contacts, and routine vision care are not included in your plan.
   
   **Important caveats or conditions:**
   - If you need vision care services beyond eye exams, these would not be covered under your current plan.
   
   **Next steps or additional help offered:**
   - If you are looking for vision care coverage, you may want to consider adding a supplemental vision insurance plan. 
   - You can speak with a human agent by calling 1-800-TOGGLE-1 for more information on available options.

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Taylor!
   
   Thanks for asking about vision care coverage under your Gold HMO plan.
   
   Here's what you need to know:
   
   **What's covered:**
   - **Eye exams** – 100% covered with no out-of-pocket costs as part of preventive care.
   
   **What's not covered:**
   - Glasses
   - Contact lenses
   - Other routine vision care services
   
   **If you need more vision coverage:**
   Since your plan doesn't include glasses and contacts, you might want to look into adding a supplemental vision insurance plan to fill that gap. It's a great way to get more comprehensive coverage for those services.
   
   **Next steps:**
   If you'd like to explore supplemental vision options or have other questions, our team is here to help. Just give us a call at **1-800-TOGGLE-1** and we can walk you through what's available.
   
   Anything else I can help clarify about your coverage?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.00, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.00 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The system provided a complete response about acupuncture coverage, scheduling appointments, and policy requirements, but there are NO RAG documents available to verify any of this information. All content appears to be fabricated without any source of truth.
   Issues:
     - No RAG documents provided as source of truth
     - All information about acupuncture coverage is unverifiable
     - HMO Network requirements stated without documentation
     - Appointment scheduling system referenced without supporting documents
     - Policy details and coverage explanations lack factual grounding

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is well-structured with clear sections and good use of formatting. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it addresses the customer's acupuncture inquiry comprehensively. However, there are some minor clarity issues around the referral process and what specific information will be covered in the call.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'Always check with your Primary Care Provider (PCP) for referrals and any necessary pre-authorizations' could be clearer about when this is required versus optional
     - The bullet points about what the specialist agent will cover are somewhat vague - 'Explain any coverage for acupuncture' doesn't specify what aspects of coverage will be discussed

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major factual error - it claims no plastic surgeons were found in the provider database, but the RAG documents don't contain any plastic surgery specialists either. However, the output fabricates specific contact information (1-800-TOGGLE-1, my.togglehealth.com/find-provider) and detailed procedures that are not found anywhere in the retrieved knowledge base documents.
   Issues:
     - Fabricated phone number '1-800-TOGGLE-1' not found in RAG documents
     - Fabricated website URL 'my.togglehealth.com/find-provider' not mentioned in knowledge base
     - Invented detailed procedures about referrals and pre-authorization without RAG document support
     - Created specific member services hours (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT) not documented in retrieved content

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all medical/insurance terms are explained appropriately for customer understanding.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (provider_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I appreciate you reaching out, Quinn. I searched the provider database for plastic surgeons in Los Angeles, but I wasn't able to find any plastic surgery specialists in my current directory.
   
   However, I do have some important information for you:
   
   **⚠️ HMO REQUIREMENT:**
   Since you have a **Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024)**, you already have a Primary Care Physician assigned, which is great! For specialist care like plastic surgery, your PCP can provide a referral, which may be required depending on the type of procedure.
   
   **OPTIONS TO FIND A PLASTIC SURGEON:**
   
   1. **Contact ToggleHealth Member Services** for the most current plastic surgery provider network:
      - **Phone:** 1-800-TOGGLE-1 (Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM PT)
      - They can verify in-network plastic surgeons accepting your Gold HMO plan
   
   2. **Use the ToggleHealth Provider Directory:**
      - Visit: **my.togglehealth.com/find-provider**
      - Search for "Plastic Surgery" or "Plastic Surgeon"
      - Filter by your location (Los Angeles, CA)
   
   3. **Speak with Your PCP:**
      - Your PCP can provide referrals to in-network plastic surgeons
      - They can also advise on whether your procedure requires pre-authorization
   
   **QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN YOU CALL:**
   - Is the plastic surgeon in-network for my TH-HMO-GOLD-2024 plan?
   - Do I need a PCP referral?
   - Is pre-authorization required for my specific procedure?
   - What are the current wait times?
   
   Would you like help with anything else, or do you need assistance contacting Member Services?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output fails to provide the user's out-of-pocket maximum despite this information being available in the RAG documents. While the response correctly lists what counts toward out-of-pocket costs, it incorrectly claims the information isn't available in the system and directs the user elsewhere for basic plan information.
   Issues:
     - Failed to provide out-of-pocket maximum information that exists in RAG documents for Gold HMO plans
     - Incorrectly states the information is not available in the system when it should be accessible
     - Unnecessarily redirects user to external sources instead of providing available information
     - Does not mention the annual deductible amount which is referenced in the coverage details

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor deduction for a very slight ambiguity in the phrase 'I don't have your specific maximum amount in the system right now' which could potentially create minor customer confusion about system capabilities.

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your **Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024)**, I don't have the specific out-of-pocket maximum amount listed in your current policy documentation.
   
   However, I can tell you what **does count** toward your out-of-pocket costs:
   - Copays for office visits ($25 for primary care, $45 for specialists)
   - Copays for emergency room visits ($350)
   - Copays for hospitalizations ($500 per admission)
   - Any coinsurance amounts you pay after meeting your deductible
   - Your annual deductible
   
   **What I need to clarify for you:**
   The policy information available to me doesn't include the exact out-of-pocket maximum for your Gold HMO plan. This is important information you should have, as it's the maximum you'd pay out-of-pocket in a calendar year before the plan covers 100% of in-network services.
   
   **I recommend:**
   Please contact Member Services at **1-800-TOGGLE-1** to confirm your exact out-of-pocket maximum. You can also check your:
   - Member ID card (usually printed on the back)
   - Welcome materials from when your coverage started
   - Online account at **my.togglehealth.com**
   
   Is there anything else about your Gold HMO coverage I can help clarify?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   💬 FINAL RESPONSE (Brand Voice):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Parker,
   
   Thanks for asking about your out-of-pocket maximum—that's definitely important information to have on hand.
   
   Here's what I found: While I can see what counts toward your out-of-pocket costs on your Gold HMO plan, I don't have your specific maximum amount in the system right now. I want to make sure you get the exact number rather than guessing.
   
   **What does count toward your out-of-pocket costs:**
   - Copays for office visits ($25 for primary care, $45 for specialists)
   - Copays for emergency room visits ($350)
   - Copays for hospitalizations ($500 per admission)
   - Coinsurance amounts you pay after meeting your deductible
   - Your annual deductible
   
   **Here's how to find your exact out-of-pocket maximum:**
   
   The quickest way is to check your Member ID card—it's usually printed on the back. You can also find this info in your welcome materials or by logging into your account at **my.togglehealth.com**.
   
   If you'd rather have someone walk you through it, just call our Member Services team at **1-800-TOGGLE-1**. They'll have your complete policy details and can answer any follow-up questions.
   
   Is there anything else about your Gold HMO coverage I can help you with?

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.70

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major factual error by stating 'I currently don't have any dentists listed in my provider directory for San Francisco' when the RAG documents clearly show multiple providers in San Francisco. While the response provides helpful guidance about finding providers, this fundamental inaccuracy about available data is a critical system failure.
   Issues:
     - Claims no dentists are available in San Francisco when RAG documents contain extensive San Francisco provider listings
     - Fails to acknowledge that the retrieved documents don't contain dental specialists, which would be the accurate statement
     - Provides generic advice instead of leveraging the actual provider data available in the knowledge base

📊 Coherence: 0.70 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is generally clear and well-structured with helpful sections and actionable steps. However, there's a significant inconsistency where the user context shows no dependents but the response addresses finding a dentist 'for your child,' creating confusion about the actual request.
   Issues:
     - Major inconsistency: responds about finding dentist for child when user has no dependents according to context
     - Could better explain what HMO referral requirements specifically mean for dental care
     - The opening apology about no dentists in directory seems premature before directing to proper search tools

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to let you know that **I don't have any dentists in my current provider directory for San Francisco**.
   
   The provider information I have access to includes primary care physicians, specialists (dermatology, endocrinology, etc.), mental health providers, and pharmacies—but unfortunately, **no pediatric or general dentists** are listed.
   
   ## Here's what I recommend:
   
   **Option 1: Find In-Network Dentists**

   - Use the **ToggleHealth Mobile app** for GPS-enabled provider search
   
   They can help you find in-network pediatric dentists accepting your **TH-HMO-GOLD-2024** plan in San Francisco.
   
   **Option 2: Important HMO Note**
   Since you have an **HMO plan**, keep in mind:
   - Some dental services may require a referral from your Primary Care Physician
   - Confirm the dentist accepts your specific plan before scheduling
   - Ask about coverage for pediatric preventive care (cleanings, exams, fluoride)
   
   **Option 3: Questions to Ask When You Call**
   - "Do you accept TH-HMO-GOLD-2024?"
   - "Are you accepting new pediatric patients?"
   - "What's your next available appointment?"

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.15, coherence=0.80

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.15 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output contains a major hallucination by claiming no addiction medicine doctors were found in Seattle, when the RAG documents don't contain any addiction medicine specialists at all - they only list dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, oncology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, psychology, and psychiatry specialists. The system should have clearly stated that addiction medicine specialists are not available in the current provider directory rather than implying they exist but couldn't be found.
   Issues:
     - Claims 'couldn't find any addiction medicine doctors in Seattle that match your criteria' when RAG documents contain no addiction medicine specialists at all
     - Implies addiction medicine doctors exist in the network but weren't found, rather than stating they're not available in the provider directory
     - Suggests expanding search area for addiction medicine specialists without evidence such providers exist in the network
     - Member Services phone number 1-800-555-TOGL (8645) is not found in RAG documents and appears to be fabricated

📊 Coherence: 0.80 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is clear, well-structured, and professional with good use of formatting. However, there's a minor inconsistency regarding PCP assignment (user context shows primary_care_assigned: true, but response suggests they may not have one) and the phone number format could be clearer.
   Issues:
     - Potential inconsistency: suggests selecting a PCP when user context indicates one is already assigned
     - Phone number format '1-800-555-TOGL (8645)' may be confusing - mixing letters and numbers

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.25, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.25 ❌ FAIL
   Reasoning: The final output claims the out-of-pocket maximum information is missing from the RAG documents, but this is incorrect. The RAG documents clearly contain out-of-pocket maximum information for other plans (PPO Platinum shows $4,500 individual/$9,000 family in-network, and $9,000 individual/$18,000 family out-of-network). While the specific Gold HMO out-of-pocket maximum isn't explicitly stated, the system should have acknowledged what information IS available rather than claiming it's completely missing.
   Issues:
     - Claims out-of-pocket maximum information is missing when RAG documents contain this data for other plans
     - Fails to mention the specific out-of-pocket maximums that are documented ($4,500/$9,000 for PPO Platinum in-network)
     - Does not acknowledge that Gold HMO specific out-of-pocket maximum may need clarification but other plan details are available

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and structure with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow from known information to missing details to actionable next steps. The tone is professional yet friendly, and medical/insurance terms are appropriately explained. Minor stylistic variations in formatting and one slightly awkward phrase about information 'not showing' could create very minor ambiguity.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'isn't showing in the information I have access to right now' is slightly awkward and could be clearer
     - Minor inconsistency in bullet point formatting between sections

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your **Gold HMO plan (TH-HMO-GOLD-2024)**, I don't have the specific out-of-pocket maximum amount listed in your current policy documentation.
   
   Here's what I can tell you about your cost sharing:
   
   **What I Know About Your Plan:**
   - You have an **annual deductible** that applies to most services
   - You pay **copays** for visits (e.g., $25 for primary care, $45 for specialists, $350 for ER)
   - You pay **coinsurance** (a percentage of costs) after your deductible is met for most services
   - **Preventive care is 100% covered** with no deductible or copay
   
   **What's Missing:**
   The exact out-of-pocket maximum amount for your Gold HMO plan isn't showing in the information I have access to right now. This is an important number—it's the maximum you'd pay in a year before the plan covers 100% of in-network services.
   
   **Next Steps:**
   I'd recommend one of these options to get your exact out-of-pocket maximum:
   
   1. **Check your policy documents** - Look for your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) or policy booklet
   2. **Visit your member portal** - Log into my.togglehealth.com
   3. **Call Member Services** - 1-800-TOGGLE-1
   
   They'll have your complete cost-sharing details right away. Is there anything else about your Gold HMO coverage I can help clarify?

   📋 SPECIALIST OUTPUT (policy_specialist):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Based on your Gold HMO plan, you do not have coverage for weight loss programs or weight management services as a standard benefit. 
   
   The policy documentation specifically lists "Weight loss programs and surgery" under the "Services NOT Covered (Exclusions)" section, unless medically necessary. 
   
   However, you may want to explore the following related benefits that are covered under your plan:
   * Nutritionist consultations are available through the Telemedicine Services (ToggleHealth Virtual Care) at no additional copay.
   * Certain health programs might be available depending on your health status, such as the Diabetes Management Program if you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.
   
   To determine if you qualify for any weight management services or alternative programs, consider the following steps:
   1. Consult with your Primary Care Physician (PCP) to discuss your weight management needs and determine if there are any medically necessary services that could be covered.
   2. Contact Member Services at 1-800-TOGGLE-1 to inquire about any available health programs or alternative resources that might support your weight management goals.
   3. Review the Special Programs Available section in your policy documentation to see if you qualify for any condition-specific programs that might include weight management components.
   
   If you need further assistance or clarification on your coverage, I recommend speaking with a human agent who can review your specific situation and provide more detailed guidance.

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately reflects all key information from the RAG documents about the Diabetes Management Program. All benefits listed (quarterly check-ins, free glucose monitor/strips, 100% education coverage, 6 nutritionist consultations) are explicitly stated in the source documents. Eligibility criteria and enrollment methods are correctly cited.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and all benefits are explained in customer-friendly language. Minor deduction for the slightly awkward greeting using the full name with number.
   Issues:
     - Greeting uses full name including number '132' which appears unnatural

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The final output accurately presents information directly from the RAG documents, including specific details about the Heart Health Program (HHP-2024) eligibility, benefits, enrollment process, and related coverage details. All key facts like copays, coverage percentages, and requirements are correctly stated from the source documents.

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response demonstrates excellent clarity and professional structure with clear headings, bullet points, and logical flow. The language is accessible while maintaining healthcare professionalism, and all medical/insurance terms are appropriately contextualized.
   Issues:
     - Minor stylistic variation in the closing 'Take care, and we're here to support you!' could be slightly more consistent with the professional tone, though it remains appropriate for healthcare customer service

📊 Judgment Metrics: accuracy=0.95, coherence=0.90

================================================================================
🔍 G-EVAL JUDGMENT RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 Accuracy: 0.95 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The output accurately presents Dr. Daniel F. Moore's information exactly as found in the RAG documents, including correct provider ID, specialty, practice name, address, phone, experience, ratings, and network status. The HMO referral requirement is appropriately mentioned based on the user's plan type.
   Issues:
     - Minor omission: The RAG document shows Dr. Moore accepts multiple plans (TH-EPO-SILVER-2024, TH-HDHP-BRONZE-2024, TH-HMO-GOLD-2024, TH-PPO-PLATINUM-2024) but output only confirms he's in-network for the user's specific plan

📊 Coherence: 0.90 ✅ PASS
   Reasoning: The response is exceptionally clear and well-structured with excellent use of formatting to organize complex information. The tone is professional yet friendly, and it provides comprehensive next steps. Minor deduction for a slightly casual phrase that could be more professional.
   Issues:
     - The phrase 'track that down for you' is slightly casual for healthcare communication - 'locate that information' would be more professional

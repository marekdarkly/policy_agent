You\u2019ll need to get these from a specialty pharmacy.\n- **Cost Comparison:** Mail order is generally more cost-effective for a 90-day supply compared to paying three separate retail copays.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Transfer Prescriptions:** To transfer your prescriptions to mail order, call ToggleHealth Mail Order at 1-800-TOGGLE-4 and provide your current pharmacy information.\n2. **Check Formulary:** Use the online formulary search at my.togglehealth.com/formulary to see which tier your medi",

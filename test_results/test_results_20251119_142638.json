      "final_response": "Hi Marek,\n\nLet's break down how your Gold HMO plan handles out-of-network providers.\n\n### Key Points About Out-of-Network Coverage\n\n* **Emergency Care**: Your plan covers emergency care at in-network rates, even if you see an out-of-network provider.\n* **Non-Emergency Care**: For non-emergency services, your plan doesn't cover out-of-network providers. That means you'll be responsible for the full cost if you see one without a valid emergency.\n\n### Important Details to Keep in Mind\n\n* Your plan is an HMO, so it typically requires you to stay within the network for coverage.\n* If you need to see a specialist, you'll usually need a referral from your Primary Care Physician (PCP).\n* Non-emergency out-of-network services are excluded from coverage according to your policy documents.\n\n### What to Do Next\n\nIf you need to see a provider outside your network for non-emergency care, consider:\n1. Reaching out to your PCP for a referral to an in-network specialist.\n2. Calling Member Services at 1",

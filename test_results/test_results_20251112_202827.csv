### Mail Order Medication Costs:
- **Tier 1 (Generic):** $20 for a 90-day supply
- **Tier 2 (Preferred Brand):** $70 for a 90-day supply
- **Tier 3 (Non-Preferred Brand):** $140 for a 90-day supply
- **Tier 4 (Specialty):** Not available by mail order

### Important Caveats:
- **Specialty Medications:** Tier 4 medications, such as Humira, are not available through mail order. You’ll need to get these from a specialty pharmacy.
- **Cost Comparison:** Mail order is generally more cost-effective for a 90-day supply compared to paying three separate retail copays.

### Next Steps:
1. **Transfer Prescriptions:** To transfer your prescriptions to mail order, call ToggleHealth Mail Order at 1-800-TOGGLE-4 and provide your current pharmacy information.
2. **Check Formulary:** Use the online formulary search at my.togglehealth.com/formulary to see which tier your medi",us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0,9719,6790,2216,311,"Hi Morgan!

Great question about mail order medications. The good news is that your Gold HMO plan does support mail order for most medications—and it's often a smart money move. Here's what you need to know:

## Mail Order Medication Costs

Your copays for a 90-day supply are:
- **Tier 1 (Generic):** $20
- **Tier 2 (Preferred Brand):** $70
- **Tier 3 (Non-Preferred Brand):** $140
- **Tier 4 (Specialty):** Not available by mail order

## Important to Know

**Specialty medications** (Tier 4, like Humira) aren't available through mail order—you'll need to use a specialty pharmacy for those instead.

**Here's the math:** Mail order is typically more cost-effective than paying three separate retail copays, so it's worth considering if you're on maintenance medications.

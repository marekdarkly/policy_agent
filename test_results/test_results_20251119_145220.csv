Great question! Let me clarify how referrals work with your Gold HMO plan.

**Good news—there are exceptions:**
- OB/GYN visits (no referral needed)
- Emergency care (no referral needed)
- Preventive care (no referral needed)

**Here's how to get started:**
1. Schedule an appointment with your PCP for an evaluation
2. Your PCP will determine if specialist care is right for you
3. If needed, your PCP will provide a written or electronic referral
4. Then you can book your specialist appointment with an in-network provider

Your Gold HMO plan does not cover out-of-network providers except for emergency care.

### KEY DETAILS
* The Gold HMO plan requires you to use in-network providers for all non-emergency care.
* Out-of-network services are not covered except in cases of true emergencies.
* For emergency care, your plan covers services at in-network rates.

* You will be responsible for the full cost if you see an out-of-network provider without a valid emergency.
* Emergency care is covered anywhere in the United States, but you must notify ToggleHealth within 48 hours.

### NEXT STEP
If you need to see a provider outside of the network for non-emergency care, you should:
1. Contact your Primary Care Physician (PCP) to discuss your needs.

- Specialist Care:",us.meta.llama4-maverick-17b-instruct-v1:0,2478,1197,2195,224,"Hi Dakota,

Let's break down how copays work with your Gold HMO plan.

**The Short Answer**
For your plan, copays apply before you meet your deductible for certain services.

**The Details**
Here's what you need to know:
* Preventive care is fully covered (100%) with no copay or deductible.
* Primary care visits have a $25 copay.
* Specialist visits have a $45 copay (you'll need a referral from your PCP).
* You'll pay these copays at the time of service.

**Important to Note**
Not all services follow this copay structure. For example:
* Hospitalization and emergency services have different cost-sharing rules.
* Services without specific copays are subject to deductible and coinsurance.

**Next Steps**
If you have specific questions about a particular service or need more details about your coverage, you can:

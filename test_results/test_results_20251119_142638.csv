Let's break down how your Gold HMO plan handles out-of-network providers.

### Key Points About Out-of-Network Coverage

* **Emergency Care**: Your plan covers emergency care at in-network rates, even if you see an out-of-network provider.
* **Non-Emergency Care**: For non-emergency services, your plan doesn't cover out-of-network providers. That means you'll be responsible for the full cost if you see one without a valid emergency.

### Important Details to Keep in Mind

* Your plan is an HMO, so it typically requires you to stay within the network for coverage.
* If you need to see a specialist, you'll usually need a referral from your Primary Care Physician (PCP).
* Non-emergency out-of-network services are excluded from coverage according to your policy documents.

### What to Do Next

If you need to see a provider outside your network for non-emergency care, consider:
1. Reaching out to your PCP for a referral to an in-network specialist.
2. Calling Member Services at 1",0.95,unknown,0.9,unknown,,success,
